    "text": "Regions\n[\nedit\n]\nSpain is a diverse country with contrasting regions that have different languages and unique historical, political and cultural traditions. Because of this, Spain is divided into 17 autonomous communities (\ncomunidades autónomas\n), plus two autonomous cities. As a result, some even describe Spain as a \"federation without federalism\". Some of the autonomous communities—notably the ones which have other official languages alongside Spanish—have been recognised as \"historical nationalities\" that have a unique historical identity. These include the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, the Valencian region, Andalusia, the Balearic Islands, Aragon and the Canary Islands.\nSpain's many regions can be grouped as follows:\nRegions of Spain\nGreen Spain\n(\nGalicia\n,\nAsturias\n,\nCantabria\n)\nMild climate, stark mountains, and ties to the sea.

There is everything from lush meadows and snowy mountains to huge marshes and deserts in the south east. While summer is the peak season, those who wish to avoid the crowds should consider visiting in the winter as not only is it normally mild and sunny, but attractions such as the Alhambra Palace in Granada and La Gran Mezquita in Cordoba will not be overcrowded. However the ski resorts of Sierra Nevada do get very crowded. The Mediterranean climate that predominates in Southern and Central Spain is noted for its dry summers and (somewhat) wet(ter) winters, so visiting in the winter or spring brings the added benefit of the vegetation looking much more healthy. Northern Spain (e.g. Asturias) on the other hand gets quite a bit of rain year round and is ripe with lush green vegetation even in August.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nSome of the earliest known remains of\nHomo\nof any kind\nin Europe\nhave been found in Spain. Spain is also thought to have been the last refuge of the Neanderthals, and one of the few places that were inhabitable and inhabited throughout the ice ages.\nEarly Spain and Roman Era\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nRoman Empire\nThe earliest inhabitants of the Iberian peninsula we have any profound knowledge of were Iberians, Celts (related to the Gaulish, Britannic and Central European Celts in language and culture) and Basques. As most of these groups had little to no written records we only know of them due to the descriptions of the Greek, Punic and later Roman settlers and conquerors, who colonised Spain from the South starting in the 3rd century BC.\nRoman culture\nlasted on the peninsula for roughly half a millennium, when in the age of migrations the Visigoths conquered the Roman province of\nHispania\n.\nVisigoth Spain\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nGoths\nMost inhabitants of the area kept speaking Latin or rather Latin-derived languages/dialects and only a handful of Germanic words entered the Spanish language (\n\"ganso\"\nbeing the most commonplace). Soon after their conquest, the Visigoths formed a number of rival \"kingdoms\" and petty noble states in almost constant conflict in ever-shifting shaky alliances with or against one another, giving rise to constant wars.\nMuslim conquest and \"al-Andalus\"\n[\nedit\n]\nAlhambra and the city of Granada\nSee also:\nIslamic Golden Age\n,\nAl-Andalus\nIn 711 one Visigoth ruler apparently called for the Umayyad Muslims to help in his fight against a rival. (Which one is unclear, as the historical records for this era in Spain are scarce and there are for example no contemporary Muslim sources whatsoever.) This proved more successful than he could have imagined, and by the end of the 8th century most of the peninsula was in Muslim hands. While the almost 800 years of divided rule by Christian and Muslim rulers on the Iberian peninsula was by no means peaceful, the modern narrative of a somehow concerted effort to \"regain\" the \"lost lands\" for Christendom was never the first, second or any priority for the majority of the Christian rulers. As a matter of fact, many times Christian rulers entered into alliances with Muslim rulers against other Christian rulers and vice versa. While the situation for Muslims in Christian lands and vice versa and Jews in either depended very much on the mood of the ruler and could lie anywhere on a range from benevolent ignorance to murder and expulsion, religious minorities had it a lot better in Spain than in most of the rest of Europe at that time. In fact the Sephardi Jews (named after the Hebrew word for Spain) were at that time not only one of the most important groups inside Spain in terms of science and education, but also dominant among the\nJewish people, worldwide\n. During that time an estimated 90% of Jews were Sephardi. (In the 19th century, on the other hand, roughly 90% of Jews were Ashkenazim [German and Eastern European, and primarily Yiddish-speaking].)\nHowever, this period ended when through conquest and marriage the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon as well as a couple of minor Christian lands were united and their rulers started a war of conquest against the Muslim rulers. The union of the numerous Christian kingdoms is commemorated in the modern Spanish coat of arms, which is an amalgamation of the coats of arms of the four main kingdoms prior to the union, namely the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, León and Navarre. In the process of re-conquering Spain, many of the great mosques and synagogues were desecrated and converted into Christian churches.\nSome of the most glorious historical attractions in Spain date from the period of Muslim rule, including\nThe Mezquita\n, built as the Great Mosque of\nCórdoba\nand the\nMedina Azahara\n, also in Córdoba and now in ruins but still visitable as such and built as the Madinat al-Zahra, the Palace of al-Andalus; and the\nAlhambra\nin\nGranada\n, a splendid, intact palace. There are also two synagogues still standing that were built during the era of Muslim Spain:\nSanta María la Blanca\nin\nToledo\nand the\nSynagogue of Córdoba\n, in the Old City.\nReconquista and Imperial era\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nAge of Discovery\nThis so-called \"reconquista\" was completed in 1492 with the fall of Granada, and all Jews were forced to leave Spain or convert that year; by 1526, all Spanish Muslims had suffered the same fate. 1492 also marks the point when Spain started to become the world's strongest empire with territories in\nNorth\n,\nCentral\nand\nSouth America\n,\nAfrica\n, and the\nPhilippines\n(named after Spanish king Felipe II). The \"new Christians\" as they were called were often not sincere in their largely forced conversions and to ensure religious \"purity\", the notorious Spanish inquisition was set up.  Genetic studies made in modern times suggest that a large percentage of modern Spaniards have at least partial Jewish and/or Muslim ancestry, which might surprise some, as the concept of being a \"true Christian\" (rather than a \"converso\") soon began to get hereditary overtones, with the expulsion of all the descendants of forced converts from Islam in 1609.\nUnder the House of Habsburg, Spain became a personal union with the\nAustrian Empire\n, and reached its height of power in Europe during the 16th and early 17th centuries, controlling much of\nBenelux\nand\nItaly\n. Spain was weakened as the House of Habsburg lost the\nThirty Years' War\nin 1648. Spain was further weakened by ineffective governance, religious intolerance that drove out the erstwhile prosperous and productive Jewish and Muslim minorities and hampered free inquiry and - paradoxically - Latin American gold and silver that devalued the currency and still couldn't cover war expenses. The Spanish Habsburgs - prone to marrying inside the family, thus accumulating inheritable diseases - died out when Charles II was unable to produce an heir, which like many of his other afflictions was likely a result of incest. Most powers of Europe fought for the possibility to put one of their own on the Spanish throne, with the House of Bourbon doing it. The Bourbons would attempt a reform of their many domains gaining some successes but enraging those who had held onto old privileges of local autonomy or feudal rights.\nThe colonisation of Central and South America and of\nMexico\nwas particularly profound, with the deaths of millions of native people through disease, war and outright murder as the Spanish sought riches in these 'undiscovered' lands. Today many of the countries in this area are defined by Hispanic language and culture (Spanish is today the world's second most spoken native language after Mandarin and before English, and Catholicism dominates throughout the former Spanish colonies).\nCrises of the 19th century\n[\nedit\n]\nWith the death of Charles III in 1788, Spain lost its last monarch with will, energy and capability for a long time at a crucial juncture - the French Revolution would break out the next year. His successor Charles IV tried at first to maintain some of his father's policies but ultimately saw more fun in hunting than politics. Soon politics in Spain would come to be dominated by Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy who was rumored to have an affair with the queen. Meanwhile, Charles' son, Ferdinand VII was chomping at the bit to replace his father as king, which earned him the contempt of the latter. In 1808 Ferdinand seemed to have briefly succeeded in replacing the hated Godoy and his father but Napoleon Bonaparte invited the two quarrelling kings to Bayonne under the pretext of mediating but forced both to abdicate in favor of his brother Joseph Bonaparte. Many among Spain's elites were having none of it and set up\nJuntas\nto maintain a government nominally loyal to Spanish monarchy. The liberal constitution of Cadiz 1812 was drafted in those years and as Ferdinand was willing to promise everyone everything to return to the throne, he came to be known as \"the Desired One\", with high hopes that he would rule as a liberal citizen-king under the constitution of Cadiz. Ferdinand never intended any such thing and his heavy-handed policies brought the wrath not only of his Spanish subjects but even of those\nJuntas\nin Latin America that had been set up without making up their mind whether to support a restoration of Bourbon rule or independence - only certain that they would oppose Napoleon and his regime. When Ferdinand died in 1833 he left a nominally absolute monarchy with an unhappy population which had lost most of its colonies to a not-yet three year old Isabella II. Immediately some hyper-conservative elements but also those in the Basque country who wanted back the old\nfuero\nautonomy refused to back Isabella's claim on account of her being female, giving birth to the \"Carlist\" movement.\nThe 19th century saw independence movements fight back against the kingdom of Spain, with leaders such as Simón Bolívar and Augustín de Iturbide successfully creating new independent nations throughout Latin America. By 1898 Spain lost the majority of its remaining territories during the Spanish-American War: it lost\nCuba\nand then sold\nPuerto Rico\n, the\nPhilippines\n, and\nGuam\nto the\nUnited States\n. The war of 1898 was a huge shock to Spanish culture and shattered Spain's self-image of a first-rate power, and it thus inspired a whole literary movement known as the generation of '98. For much of this time, Spain was not really\none\nrealm so much as\nseveral\nrealms which shared a monarch. While the monarch had broad powers, there was no such thing as \"absolute\" monarchy in Spain and the various regions - notably the Basque country - had numerous special privileges and autonomies granted either to \"the people\", a local lord or \"free men\". This proved complicated to resolve when Spain became a Republic and it is still an issue with which Spain is grappling in the 21st century.\nSagrada Familia, the Gaudi masterpiece in the\nEixample\nregion of\nBarcelona\nThe 20th century\n[\nedit\n]\nSpain experienced a devastating civil war between 1936 and 1939 that killed half a million Spaniards and ushered in more than 30 years of dictatorship under Generalissimo Francisco Franco. The civil war began from a mostly failed coup in Spanish North Africa (today part of Morocco) against Spain's left-wing republican government supported by the popular front (a popular front was in those days a regime including communist, socialist, liberal, Christian Democrat and even conservative parties and originated in France as a response to fascism, though the parties in power in July 1936 were Izquierda Republicana and Unión Republicana, two centre-left wing republican parties, supported by PSOE; the communist party had just 17 seats). The fascist side was led by a group of generals; however, some of them soon died in plane crashes or were pushed to the side by Franco. Although the League of Nations (a precursor of today's United Nations) attempted to make intervention impossible, Mussolini's Italy and Nazi Germany ignored this by aiding the nationalist (Franco) side, while the Soviet Union and to some extent Mexico provided aid to the Republican (popular front) side. The Republican side called for volunteers in the so-called \"international brigades\", and around 20,000 Brits, Americans, Frenchmen and even Germans joined the fight on their side. However, the Republican side was plagued by lack of weapons and ammunition (some of their rifles were produced in the 19th century), by infighting between communists and anarchists, and by Stalinist purges ordered by the super-paranoid supporters of Republican Spain in Moscow. As many people of that generation fought in the Spanish Civil War or covered it as – often blatantly biased – war correspondents (including George Orwell, Ernest Hemingway and later German chancellor Willy Brandt) there is a lot of well-written literature (and some films), which while not always historically accurate, manage to perfectly capture the spirit of vain idealism that made many of the interbrigadistas go to Spain in the first place. Just as the\nAmerican Civil War\ngave a breakthrough for photojournalism,\nWorld War I\nfor news radio and World War II for the newsreel, the Spanish Civil War made its mark on journalism, literature and arts. The Reina Sofia museum in Madrid has an exhibition for artistic expressions of the war, with Picasso's\nGuernica\n– produced for the republican Spanish pavilion at the 1937 world exhibition in Paris – as its centrepiece.\nThe war was won for Franco through superior fire-power and with military aid from the Nazis (including the war-crime of bombing\nGuernica\n). Franco managed to unify the not at all homogeneous nationalist forces behind his less-than-charismatic leadership and hold onto power through the\nSecond World War\n(in which he stayed neutral) until his death. He was succeeded by King Juan Carlos. The Spanish Civil War is still in some sense an open wound as it was hardly ever talked about during the days of Franco's regime. To this day, conservatives and Catholics (the Republicans were pretty anti-clerical) are sometimes apologetic about Franco and the \"necessity\" of the war. Franco's legacy was that the historically important regional identities and languages (such as Catalan and Basque) were brutally suppressed and a policy of strong national identity under the Spanish/Castilian language was promoted. Many Republican soldiers and supported continued fighting until the mid 50s in the so-called maquis, in 1944 there was even an attempt to invade Spain from France through the Vall d'Aran in 1944 which was quickly suppressed by the Guardia Civil. Violent groups such as ETA (see below) started their activity in the 1960s during Franco's time, there was also an increasing protest movement in the last years of franquism. Franco oversaw Spain's rapid economic expansion with its industrialisation in the 1960s. Spain's messy divorce from its African colonies in the last years and days of Franco's life is also one of the reasons for the conflict in\nWestern Sahara\n, a former Spanish colony.\nFranco named Juan Carlos as his successor in 1969, with Juan Carlos being crowned king shortly after Franco's death. Shortly after King Juan Carlos – to the surprise of many – insisted on the country becoming a parliamentary democracy with a figurehead king as nominal head of state, right-wing generals tried to overthrow the nascent democracy on 23 February 1981 in what is now known as 23F. One of the most striking images of the coup was the general Tejero storming into the Congress of Deputies at the head of 200 Guardia Civil members and interrupting the vote to replace centre-left Adolfo Suarez with centre-right Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo for Prime Minister. The coup failed mostly due to lack of popular support and because the king – in his capacity of commander-in-chief – appeared on television in full uniform to order the soldiers back into their barracks, thus throwing his lot in with democracy. This resulted in a lot of support for the king personally even among otherwise republican-inclined Spaniards for most of his reign. However, the monarchy is rather unpopular among the autonomist or independist movements of Catalonia or the Basque Country. Spain entered NATO (though not the EU or any of its predecessors) in 1982, which Calvo-Sotelo. The ruling centre-right party UCD under Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo badly misjudged the Andalusian desire for regional self-government and thus lost the 1982 election, in one of the biggest popular vote landslides in any modern democracy, to the leftist PSOE. This led to the formation of Partido Popular (PP) from the rubble left behind by the temporary collapse of the centre-right. PSOE was led at that time by the relatively youthful Andalusian Felipe González and enjoys a strong basis of support in Andalusia to this day.\nWith the peaceful transition to democracy after Franco's death, the restrictions on regional identity were lifted, with autonomy granted to several regions, and the regional languages gaining co-official status in their respective areas. The nature of the transition meant that there was little justice for those who had suffered under the Franco dictatorship and divisions still remain.\nThe Basque Country in Spain's north that had begun violent resistance in 1959 against Franco continued its campaign of bombings and assassinations into the democratic era with the terrorist ETA (Euskadi ta Askatasuna; Basque for Basque Country and Freedom) group, despite the region having been provided with a high degree of autonomy. The group declared a ceasefire in 2011 and the armed struggle appears over for the time being. Even in the \"democratic\" 1980s, (under longtime Prime minister Felipe González [PSOE 1982–1996]) the Spanish government responded with methods that are now known to have included \"death squadrons\" to combat terrorism.\n21st century\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the 2000s there was more economic expansion and a housing price boom that subsequently collapsed, leaving Spain with high unemployment and economic difficulties. The economically important Catalan region has become louder in its demands for independence. In 2017/18 this conflict erupted as the central government had worked to annul key aspects of a more extensive statute of autonomy while parts of the Catalan parliament held an independence referendum, deemed \"illegal\" by opponents of independence. The central government cracked down heavily on the independence movement and several people involved in the referendum were sentenced to lengthy prison terms.\nMigration\n[\nedit\n]\nSpain holds a historical attachment to its neighbours on the Iberian Peninsula,\nAndorra\nand\nPortugal\n, to its former colonies, to former citizens and their descendants, and to a special category of former citizens, namely Sephardic Jews.\nThe population of Spain is growing in large part due to migration by people from relatively poor or politically unstable areas of Latin America, such as\nColombia\n,\nCuba\n,\nEcuador\n,\nEl Salvador\nNicaragua\n,\nPeru\nor\nVenezuela\n; other parts of Europe, especially Eastern Europe; and Africa and Asia, particularly areas that have a historical or linguistic attachment to Spain. There is also an important segment of immigration that consists mainly of retired people, and people running businesses for them and foreign tourists, coming from wealthier European countries such as the\nUnited Kingdom\n,\nFrance\n,\nGermany\n,\nBenelux\nand the\nNordic countries\n, established all along the Mediterranean shore, especially in the\nCosta Blanca\n,\nCosta del Sol\n, the\nCanary Islands\nand the\nBalearic Islands\n, particularly in the summer months.\nInternally there have always been migrations from poorer rural areas (such as Andalusia) to the cities and to jobs in construction and tourism. Due to the economic crisis of the 2000s and 2010s, youth unemployment has risen to unbearable levels in the 50% range and quite a number of young people have semi-permanently fled the country to other European Union countries such as Germany to study, work or do internships either until things get better in Spain or forever. In the latter half of the 2010s there were tentative signs of economic improvement with some economic emigrants returning to Spain.\nTourist information\n[\nedit\n]\nTourist information website\nof the Spanish government."

Genetic studies made in modern times suggest that a large percentage of modern Spaniards have at least partial Jewish and/or Muslim ancestry, which might surprise some, as the concept of being a \"true Christian\" (rather than a \"converso\") soon began to get hereditary overtones, with the expulsion of all the descendants of forced converts from Islam in 1609.\nUnder the House of Habsburg, Spain became a personal union with the\nAustrian Empire\n, and reached its height of power in Europe during the 16th and early 17th centuries, controlling much of\nBenelux\nand\nItaly\n. Spain was weakened as the House of Habsburg lost the\nThirty Years' War\nin 1648. Spain was further weakened by ineffective governance, religious intolerance that drove out the erstwhile prosperous and productive Jewish and Muslim minorities and hampered free inquiry and - paradoxically - Latin American gold and silver that devalued the currency and still couldn't cover war expenses. The Spanish Habsburgs - prone to marrying inside the family, thus accumulating inheritable diseases - died out when Charles II was unable to produce an heir, which like many of his other afflictions was likely a result of incest. Most powers of Europe fought for the possibility to put one of their own on the Spanish throne, with the House of Bourbon doing it. The Bourbons would attempt a reform of their many domains gaining some successes but enraging those who had held onto old privileges of local autonomy or feudal rights.\nThe colonisation of Central and South America and of\nMexico\nwas particularly profound, with the deaths of millions of native people through disease, war and outright murder as the Spanish sought riches in these 'undiscovered' lands. Today many of the countries in this area are defined by Hispanic language and culture (Spanish is today the world's second most spoken native language after Mandarin and before English, and Catholicism dominates throughout the former Spanish colonies).\nCrises of the 19th century\n[\nedit\n]\nWith the death of Charles III in 1788, Spain lost its last monarch with will, energy and capability for a long time at a crucial juncture - the French Revolution would break out the next year. His successor Charles IV tried at first to maintain some of his father's policies but ultimately saw more fun in hunting than politics. Soon politics in Spain would come to be dominated by Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy who was rumored to have an affair with the queen. Meanwhile, Charles' son, Ferdinand VII was chomping at the bit to replace his father as king, which earned him the contempt of the latter. In 1808 Ferdinand seemed to have briefly succeeded in replacing the hated Godoy and his father but Napoleon Bonaparte invited the two quarrelling kings to Bayonne under the pretext of mediating but forced both to abdicate in favor of his brother Joseph Bonaparte. Many among Spain's elites were having none of it and set up\nJuntas\nto maintain a government nominally loyal to Spanish monarchy. The liberal constitution of Cadiz 1812 was drafted in those years and as Ferdinand was willing to promise everyone everything to return to the throne, he came to be known as \"the Desired One\", with high hopes that he would rule as a liberal citizen-king under the constitution of Cadiz. Ferdinand never intended any such thing and his heavy-handed policies brought the wrath not only of his Spanish subjects but even of those\nJuntas\nin Latin America that had been set up without making up their mind whether to support a restoration of Bourbon rule or independence - only certain that they would oppose Napoleon and his regime. When Ferdinand died in 1833 he left a nominally absolute monarchy with an unhappy population which had lost most of its colonies to a not-yet three year old Isabella II. Immediately some hyper-conservative elements but also those in the Basque country who wanted back the old\nfuero\nautonomy refused to back Isabella's claim on account of her being female, giving birth to the \"Carlist\" movement.\nThe 19th century saw independence movements fight back against the kingdom of Spain, with leaders such as Simón Bolívar and Augustín de Iturbide successfully creating new independent nations throughout Latin America. By 1898 Spain lost the majority of its remaining territories during the Spanish-American War: it lost\nCuba\nand then sold\nPuerto Rico\n, the\nPhilippines\n, and\nGuam\nto the\nUnited States\n. The war of 1898 was a huge shock to Spanish culture and shattered Spain's self-image of a first-rate power, and it thus inspired a whole literary movement known as the generation of '98. For much of this time, Spain was not really\none\nrealm so much as\nseveral\nrealms which shared a monarch. While the monarch had broad powers, there was no such thing as \"absolute\" monarchy in Spain and the various regions - notably the Basque country - had numerous special privileges and autonomies granted either to \"the people\", a local lord or \"free men\". This proved complicated to resolve when Spain became a Republic and it is still an issue with which Spain is grappling in the 21st century.\nSagrada Familia, the Gaudi masterpiece in the\nEixample\nregion of\nBarcelona\nThe 20th century\n[\nedit\n]\nSpain experienced a devastating civil war between 1936 and 1939 that killed half a million Spaniards and ushered in more than 30 years of dictatorship under Generalissimo Francisco Franco. The civil war began from a mostly failed coup in Spanish North Africa (today part of Morocco) against Spain's left-wing republican government supported by the popular front (a popular front was in those days a regime including communist, socialist, liberal, Christian Democrat and even conservative parties and originated in France as a response to fascism, though the parties in power in July 1936 were Izquierda Republicana and Unión Republicana, two centre-left wing republican parties, supported by PSOE; the communist party had just 17 seats). The fascist side was led by a group of generals; however, some of them soon died in plane crashes or were pushed to the side by Franco. Although the League of Nations (a precursor of today's United Nations) attempted to make intervention impossible, Mussolini's Italy and Nazi Germany ignored this by aiding the nationalist (Franco) side, while the Soviet Union and to some extent Mexico provided aid to the Republican (popular front) side. The Republican side called for volunteers in the so-called \"international brigades\", and around 20,000 Brits, Americans, Frenchmen and even Germans joined the fight on their side. However, the Republican side was plagued by lack of weapons and ammunition (some of their rifles were produced in the 19th century), by infighting between communists and anarchists, and by Stalinist purges ordered by the super-paranoid supporters of Republican Spain in Moscow. As many people of that generation fought in the Spanish Civil War or covered it as – often blatantly biased – war correspondents (including George Orwell, Ernest Hemingway and later German chancellor Willy Brandt) there is a lot of well-written literature (and some films), which while not always historically accurate, manage to perfectly capture the spirit of vain idealism that made many of the interbrigadistas go to Spain in the first place. Just as the\nAmerican Civil War\ngave a breakthrough for photojournalism,\nWorld War I\nfor news radio and World War II for the newsreel, the Spanish Civil War made its mark on journalism, literature and arts. The Reina Sofia museum in Madrid has an exhibition for artistic expressions of the war, with Picasso's\nGuernica\n– produced for the republican Spanish pavilion at the 1937 world exhibition in Paris – as its centrepiece.\nThe war was won for Franco through superior fire-power and with military aid from the Nazis (including the war-crime of bombing\nGuernica\n). Franco managed to unify the not at all homogeneous nationalist forces behind his less-than-charismatic leadership and hold onto power through the\nSecond World War\n(in which he stayed neutral) until his death. He was succeeded by King Juan Carlos. The Spanish Civil War is still in some sense an open wound as it was hardly ever talked about during the days of Franco's regime. To this day, conservatives and Catholics (the Republicans were pretty anti-clerical) are sometimes apologetic about Franco and the \"necessity\" of the war. Franco's legacy was that the historically important regional identities and languages (such as Catalan and Basque) were brutally suppressed and a policy of strong national identity under the Spanish/Castilian language was promoted. Many Republican soldiers and supported continued fighting until the mid 50s in the so-called maquis, in 1944 there was even an attempt to invade Spain from France through the Vall d'Aran in 1944 which was quickly suppressed by the Guardia Civil. Violent groups such as ETA (see below) started their activity in the 1960s during Franco's time, there was also an increasing protest movement in the last years of franquism. Franco oversaw Spain's rapid economic expansion with its industrialisation in the 1960s. Spain's messy divorce from its African colonies in the last years and days of Franco's life is also one of the reasons for the conflict in\nWestern Sahara\n, a former Spanish colony.\nFranco named Juan Carlos as his successor in 1969, with Juan Carlos being crowned king shortly after Franco's death. Shortly after King Juan Carlos – to the surprise of many – insisted on the country becoming a parliamentary democracy with a figurehead king as nominal head of state, right-wing generals tried to overthrow the nascent democracy on 23 February 1981 in what is now known as 23F. One of the most striking images of the coup was the general Tejero storming into the Congress of Deputies at the head of 200 Guardia Civil members and interrupting the vote to replace centre-left Adolfo Suarez with centre-right Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo for Prime Minister. The coup failed mostly due to lack of popular support and because the king – in his capacity of commander-in-chief – appeared on television in full uniform to order the soldiers back into their barracks, thus throwing his lot in with democracy. This resulted in a lot of support for the king personally even among otherwise republican-inclined Spaniards for most of his reign. However, the monarchy is rather unpopular among the autonomist or independist movements of Catalonia or the Basque Country. Spain entered NATO (though not the EU or any of its predecessors) in 1982, which Calvo-Sotelo. The ruling centre-right party UCD under Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo badly misjudged the Andalusian desire for regional self-government and thus lost the 1982 election, in one of the biggest popular vote landslides in any modern democracy, to the leftist PSOE. This led to the formation of Partido Popular (PP) from the rubble left behind by the temporary collapse of the centre-right. PSOE was led at that time by the relatively youthful Andalusian Felipe González and enjoys a strong basis of support in Andalusia to this day.\nWith the peaceful transition to democracy after Franco's death, the restrictions on regional identity were lifted, with autonomy granted to several regions, and the regional languages gaining co-official status in their respective areas. The nature of the transition meant that there was little justice for those who had suffered under the Franco dictatorship and divisions still remain.\nThe Basque Country in Spain's north that had begun violent resistance in 1959 against Franco continued its campaign of bombings and assassinations into the democratic era with the terrorist ETA (Euskadi ta Askatasuna; Basque for Basque Country and Freedom) group, despite the region having been provided with a high degree of autonomy. The group declared a ceasefire in 2011 and the armed struggle appears over for the time being. Even in the \"democratic\" 1980s, (under longtime Prime minister Felipe González [PSOE 1982–1996]) the Spanish government responded with methods that are now known to have included \"death squadrons\" to combat terrorism.\n21st century\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the 2000s there was more economic expansion and a housing price boom that subsequently collapsed, leaving Spain with high unemployment and economic difficulties. The economically important Catalan region has become louder in its demands for independence. In 2017/18 this conflict erupted as the central government had worked to annul key aspects of a more extensive statute of autonomy while parts of the Catalan parliament held an independence referendum, deemed \"illegal\" by opponents of independence. The central government cracked down heavily on the independence movement and several people involved in the referendum were sentenced to lengthy prison terms.\nMigration\n[\nedit\n]\nSpain holds a historical attachment to its neighbours on the Iberian Peninsula,\nAndorra\nand\nPortugal\n, to its former colonies, to former citizens and their descendants, and to a special category of former citizens, namely Sephardic Jews.\nThe population of Spain is growing in large part due to migration by people from relatively poor or politically unstable areas of Latin America, such as\nColombia\n,\nCuba\n,\nEcuador\n,\nEl Salvador\nNicaragua\n,\nPeru\nor\nVenezuela\n; other parts of Europe, especially Eastern Europe; and Africa and Asia, particularly areas that have a historical or linguistic attachment to Spain. There is also an important segment of immigration that consists mainly of retired people, and people running businesses for them and foreign tourists, coming from wealthier European countries such as the\nUnited Kingdom\n,\nFrance\n,\nGermany\n,\nBenelux\nand the\nNordic countries\n, established all along the Mediterranean shore, especially in the\nCosta Blanca\n,\nCosta del Sol\n, the\nCanary Islands\nand the\nBalearic Islands\n, particularly in the summer months.\nInternally there have always been migrations from poorer rural areas (such as Andalusia) to the cities and to jobs in construction and tourism. Due to the economic crisis of the 2000s and 2010s, youth unemployment has risen to unbearable levels in the 50% range and quite a number of young people have semi-permanently fled the country to other European Union countries such as Germany to study, work or do internships either until things get better in Spain or forever. In the latter half of the 2010s there were tentative signs of economic improvement with some economic emigrants returning to Spain."

(Which one is unclear, as the historical records for this era in Spain are scarce and there are for example no contemporary Muslim sources whatsoever.) This proved more successful than he could have imagined, and by the end of the 8th century most of the peninsula was in Muslim hands. While the almost 800 years of divided rule by Christian and Muslim rulers on the Iberian peninsula was by no means peaceful, the modern narrative of a somehow concerted effort to \"regain\" the \"lost lands\" for Christendom was never the first, second or any priority for the majority of the Christian rulers. As a matter of fact, many times Christian rulers entered into alliances with Muslim rulers against other Christian rulers and vice versa. While the situation for Muslims in Christian lands and vice versa and Jews in either depended very much on the mood of the ruler and could lie anywhere on a range from benevolent ignorance to murder and expulsion, religious minorities had it a lot better in Spain than in most of the rest of Europe at that time. In fact the Sephardi Jews (named after the Hebrew word for Spain) were at that time not only one of the most important groups inside Spain in terms of science and education, but also dominant among the\nJewish people, worldwide\n. During that time an estimated 90% of Jews were Sephardi. (In the 19th century, on the other hand, roughly 90% of Jews were Ashkenazim [German and Eastern European, and primarily Yiddish-speaking].)\nHowever, this period ended when through conquest and marriage the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon as well as a couple of minor Christian lands were united and their rulers started a war of conquest against the Muslim rulers. The union of the numerous Christian kingdoms is commemorated in the modern Spanish coat of arms, which is an amalgamation of the coats of arms of the four main kingdoms prior to the union, namely the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, León and Navarre. In the process of re-conquering Spain, many of the great mosques and synagogues were desecrated and converted into Christian churches.\nSome of the most glorious historical attractions in Spain date from the period of Muslim rule, including\nThe Mezquita\n, built as the Great Mosque of\nCórdoba\nand the\nMedina Azahara\n, also in Córdoba and now in ruins but still visitable as such and built as the Madinat al-Zahra, the Palace of al-Andalus; and the\nAlhambra\nin\nGranada\n, a splendid, intact palace. There are also two synagogues still standing that were built during the era of Muslim Spain:\nSanta María la Blanca\nin\nToledo\nand the\nSynagogue of Córdoba\n, in the Old City."

There is also an important segment of immigration that consists mainly of retired people, and people running businesses for them and foreign tourists, coming from wealthier European countries such as the\nUnited Kingdom\n,\nFrance\n,\nGermany\n,\nBenelux\nand the\nNordic countries\n, established all along the Mediterranean shore, especially in the\nCosta Blanca\n,\nCosta del Sol\n, the\nCanary Islands\nand the\nBalearic Islands\n, particularly in the summer months.\nInternally there have always been migrations from poorer rural areas (such as Andalusia) to the cities and to jobs in construction and tourism. Due to the economic crisis of the 2000s and 2010s, youth unemployment has risen to unbearable levels in the 50% range and quite a number of young people have semi-permanently fled the country to other European Union countries such as Germany to study, work or do internships either until things get better in Spain or forever. In the latter half of the 2010s there were tentative signs of economic improvement with some economic emigrants returning to Spain."

    "text": "Talk\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nSpanish phrasebook\nI'm so pregnant\nMany English words have their origins in Latin, which makes it easy for English speakers to guess the meanings of many Spanish words. However, Spanish and English also have a number of false friends that one needs to be aware of to avoid embarrassing mistakes.\nembarazada\n– pregnant;\nnot\nembarrassed\npreservativo\n– condom;\nnot\npreservative\nactual\n– current, present;\nnot\nactual\nbizarro\n– brave;\nnot\nbizarre\nlibrería\n– bookshop;\nnot\nlibrary\ncarta\n- letter;\nnot\ncard\néxito\n- success,\nnot\nexit\nparada\n- stop,\nnot\nparade\nropa\n- clothes,\nnot\nrope\ncarpeta\n- folder,\nnot\ncarpet\nThe official and universal language used in Spain is Spanish (\nespañol\n) which is a member of the Romance family of languages (others include Portuguese, Italian, French, and Romanian). Many people, especially outside Castile, prefer to call it\nCastilian\n(\ncastellano\n).\nHowever, there are a number of languages (Catalan, Basque, Galician, Asturian, etc.) spoken in various parts of Spain. Some of these languages are dominant and co-official in their respective regions, though most people will be bilingual in their local language and Spanish. Catalan, Basque and Galician are recognised as official languages according to the Spanish constitution. With the exception of Basque (whose origins are still debated), the languages of the Iberian Peninsula are part of the Romance family and are fairly easy to pick up if you know Castilian well.\nCatalan\n(Catalan:\ncatalà\n, Castilian:\ncatalán\n), a distinct language similar to Castilian but more closely related to the Oc branch of the Romance Languages and considered by many to be part of a dialect continuum spanning across Spain, France, and Italy and including the other langues d'oc such as Provençal, Beàrnais, Limousin, Auvernhat and Niçard. Various dialects are spoken in the northeastern region of\nCatalonia\n, the\nBalearic Islands\n, and\nValencia\n(where it is often referred to as\nValencià\n), east of\nAragon\n, as well as neighbouring\nAndorra\nand southern France. To a casual listener, Catalan superficially appears to be a cross of Castilian, French and Portuguese and though it does share features of all three, it is a separate language.\nGalician\n(Galician:\ngalego\n, Castilian:\ngallego\n), very closely related to Portuguese, Galician is spoken in\nGalicia\nand the western portions of\nAsturias\nand\nLeón\n. Galician predates Portuguese and is deemed one of the four main dialects of the Galician-Portuguese language family group which includes Brazilian, Southern Portuguese, Central Portuguese, and Galician. While the Portuguese consider it a dialect of Portuguese, Galicians consider their language separate.\nBasque\n(Basque:\neuskara\n, Castilian:\nvasco\n), a language unrelated to Castilian (or any other known language in the world), is spoken in the three provinces of the\nBasque Country\n, on the two adjacent provinces on the French side of the Spain-French border, and in Navarre. Basque is considered a language isolate unrelated to any Romance, Indo-European, or even any known language, save for a weak theory that Basque could be related to Aquitanian.\nAsturiano\n(Asturiano:\nasturianu\n, Castilian:\nasturiano\n, also known as\nbable\n), spoken in the province of\nAsturias\n, where it enjoys semi-official protection. It was also spoken in rural parts of\nLeón\n,\nZamora\n,\nSalamanca\n, in a few villages in Portugal (where it is called Mirandes) and in villages in the extreme north of\nExtremadura\n. While the constitution of Spain explicitly protects Basque, Balearic-Catalan-Valencian under the term Catalan, Galician, and Castilian, it does not explicitly protect Asturian. Still, the province of Asturias explicitly protects it, and Spain implicitly protects it by not objecting before the Supreme Court.\nAragonese\n(Aragonese:\naragonés\n, Castilian:\naragonés\n, also known colloquially as\nfabla\n), spoken in the north of\nAragon\n, and is not officially recognised. This language is close to Catalan (specially in\nBenasque\n) and to Castilian, with some Basque and Occitan (southern France) influences. Nowadays, only a few villages near the\nPyrenees\nuse the language vigorously, while most people mix it with Castilian in their daily speech.\nAranese\n(Castilian:\nAranés\n, Catalan/Aranese Occitan:\nAranès\n), spoken in the Aran Valley and recognised as an official language of Catalonia (not of Spain), alongside Catalan and Castilian. This language is a variety of Gascon Occitan, and as such is very closely related to Provençal, Limousin, Languedoc, and Catalan.\nIn addition to the native languages, many languages such as English,\nFrench\n, and\nGerman\nare commonly studied in school. However, Spaniards are not known for their proficiency in foreign languages, and it is very rare to find locals conversant in foreign languages outside of tourist establishments or major international hotels. Most establishments in Spain's important tourist industry, however, have staff members who speak a decent level of English, particularly in popular beach resorts such as those in the\nCosta del Sol\nwhere you will find people who are fluent in several languages, the most common ones being German and French. As\nPortuguese\nand\nItalian\nare closely related to Spanish, if you speak either of these languages, locals would be able to puzzle you out with some difficulty. German is spoken in some areas frequented by German tourists, such as Mallorca. In general, people who speak two national languages (e.g. Basque and Castilian or Catalan and Castilian) are more likely to speak a foreign language than monolingual Spanish speakers.\nCastilian Spanish differs from the\nLatin American Spanish\nvarieties in pronunciation and grammar, although all Latin American varieties are easily understood by Spaniards and vice-versa. While the differences in spelling are virtually non-existent, the differences in vocabulary and pronunciation between Castilian Spanish and \"Latin American Spanish\" are arguably bigger than those between \"American\" and \"British\" English.\nFrench is the most widely understood foreign language in the northeast of Spain. The Basque region and northern Catalonia in particular have sizable populations that speak French.\nLocals will appreciate any attempts you make to speak their language. For example, know at least the Castilian for \"good morning\" (\nbuenos días\n) and \"thank you\" (\ngracias\n)."

Another issue with the Spanish Rail network is that the lines are disposed in a radial way so almost all the lines head to Madrid. That's why sometimes travelling from one city to another geographically close to it might take longer by train than by bus if they are not on the same line. Always check whether the bus or the train is more convenient. The Spanish\nhigh speed rail\nsystem is, however, more reliable than that of - say - Germany, because the gauge of traditional and high speed trains is different and thus high speed lines are only used by high speed passenger trains meaning fewer delays due to congested lines or technical problems. All lines that cross the border into France have either a break of gauge (thus making changing train or a lengthy gauge change necessary) or are high speed, thus making the high speed trains the vastly preferable option to cross the border. Trains between Barcelona and France are operated jointly by\nSNCF\nand\nrenfe\nand both sell tickets for any international train on that route. Spain has numerous rail links with neighbouring Portugal, none of them high speed. There are only three rail links with France, one at\nHendaye\non a traditional line requiring a break of gauge, a connection used for local traffic near Latour de Carol (this is the closest rail line to\nAndorra\n) and one near\nFigueres\nfor high speed trains.

The Prado goes back to the former royal collection and the Reina Sofia Museum is named for King Juan Carlos' wife, in practice the dividing line between the two is largely one of era, with anything made roughly after the birth of Picasso found in the Reina Sofia and everything else in the Prado.\nBarcelona\nis renowned for its stunning collection of modern and contemporary art and architecture. This is where you will find the\nPicasso Museum\n, which covers the artist's early career quite well, and the architectural wonders of\nAntoni Gaudi\n, with their twisting organic forms that are a delight to look at.\nOutside of Madrid and Barcelona, the art museums quickly dwindle in size and importance, although there are a couple of worthy mentions that should not be overlooked. Many of El Greco's most famous works lie in\nToledo\n, an easy day trip from Madrid.\nThe Disrobing of Christ\n, perhaps El Greco's most famous work, sits in the cathedral, but you can also find work by him in one of the small art museums around town.\nBilbao\nin the Basque Country of northern Spain is home to a spectacular\nGuggenheim Museum\ndesigned by Frank Gehry that has put the city on the map. A day trip from Barcelona is the town of\nFigueres\n, noted for the\nSalvador Dalí Museum\n, designed by the Surrealist himself.\nMálaga\nin the south is Picasso's city of birth, and is also home to two museums dedicated to his life and works."

As a result, you may find that waiters are not as attentive or courteous as you may be used to since they don't work for tips.  If you choose to tip, the tip amount in restaurants depends on your economic status, the locale and type of establishment.

If you don't, it is no big deal.\nBars expect only tourists, particularly American tourists, to leave a tip. They are aware that it is customary in the United States to leave a tip for every drink or meal. It is rare to see anyone other than Americans tipping in Spain. In major resorts tipping may be common; look around at other diners to assess if tipping is appropriate.\nOutside the restaurant business, some service providers, such as taxi drivers, hairdressers and hotel personnel may expect a tip in an upscale setting.\nBusiness hours\n[\nedit\n]\nMost businesses (including most shops, but not restaurants) close in the afternoons around 13:30/14:00 and reopen for the evening around 16:30/17:00. Exceptions are large malls or major chain stores.\nFor most Spaniards, lunch is the main meal of the day and you will find bars and restaurants open during this time. On Saturdays, businesses often do not reopen in the evening and almost everywhere is closed on Sundays. The exception is the month of December, where most shops in Madrid and Barcelona will be open as per on weekdays on Sundays to cash in on the festive season. Also, many public offices and banks do not reopen in the evenings even on weekdays, so if you have any important business to take care of, be sure to check hours of operation.\nIf you plan to spend whole day shopping in small shops, the following rule of thumb can work: a closed shop should remind it's also time for your own lunch.

If you choose to tip, the tip amount in restaurants depends on your economic status, the locale and type of establishment. If you feel that you have experienced good service then leave some loose change on the table - possibly €1  or €2. If you don't, it is no big deal.\nBars expect only tourists, particularly American tourists, to leave a tip. They are aware that it is customary in the United States to leave a tip for every drink or meal. It is rare to see anyone other than Americans tipping in Spain. In major resorts tipping may be common; look around at other diners to assess if tipping is appropriate.\nOutside the restaurant business, some service providers, such as taxi drivers, hairdressers and hotel personnel may expect a tip in an upscale setting."

    "text": "Business hours\n[\nedit\n]\nMost businesses (including most shops, but not restaurants) close in the afternoons around 13:30/14:00 and reopen for the evening around 16:30/17:00. Exceptions are large malls or major chain stores.\nFor most Spaniards, lunch is the main meal of the day and you will find bars and restaurants open during this time. On Saturdays, businesses often do not reopen in the evening and almost everywhere is closed on Sundays. The exception is the month of December, where most shops in Madrid and Barcelona will be open as per on weekdays on Sundays to cash in on the festive season. Also, many public offices and banks do not reopen in the evenings even on weekdays, so if you have any important business to take care of, be sure to check hours of operation.\nIf you plan to spend whole day shopping in small shops, the following rule of thumb can work: a closed shop should remind it's also time for your own lunch. And when you finish your lunch, some shops will be likely open again.\nGran Vía of Madrid, is a perfect place for shopping"

    "text": "Eat\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nSpanish cuisine\nSpanish cuisine may not enjoy the prestige that French or Italian cuisine does in the Anglosphere, but it has skyrocketed in popularity in the 21st century, driven in no small part by the large number of Spanish celebrity chefs who have been making waves around the\nfine dining\nworld.\nThe Spaniards are very passionate about their food and wine. Spanish food can be described as quite light with a lot of vegetables and a huge variety of meat and fish. Perhaps owing to the inquisition trying to \"find out\" lapsed\nconversos\npork (religiously prohibited in both Judaism and Islam) is easily the most consumed meat and features prominently in many dishes. Spanish cuisine does not use many spices; it relies only on the use of high quality ingredients to give a good taste. As such, you may find Spanish food bland at times but there are usually a variety of restaurants in most cities (Italian, Chinese, American fast food) if you would like to experience a variety of flavors. If you are familiar with Latin American cuisines, keep in mind that many Spanish dishes may have the same name as several Latin American dishes, but actually refer to completely different dishes (e.g.\ntortilla\n,\nhorchata\nand\nmazapán\nrefer to completely different things in Spain and Mexico).\nLike much of Europe, Spain's top tourism destinations are full of tourist-trap restaurants that serve overpriced and mediocre food. If you want a good and reasonably-priced meal, it's generally best to go to restaurants with a primarily local clientele. However, as it is rare to find English-speaking waiters in such establishments, be prepared to have to speak some Spanish.\nBreakfast, lunch and dinner times\n[\nedit\n]\nSpaniards have a different eating timetable than many people are used to.\nThe key thing to remember for a traveller is:\nbreakfast (\ndesayuno\n) for most Spaniards is light and consists of just coffee and perhaps a\ngalleta\n(like a graham cracker) or\nmagdalena\n(sweet muffin-like bread).  Later, some will go to a cafe for a pastry midmorning, but not too close to lunchtime.\n\"el aperitivo\" is a light snack eaten around 12:00. However, this could include a couple of glasses of beer and a large filled baguette or a \"pincho de tortilla\".\n\"Pinchos\" in Barcelona\nlunch (\ncomida\n) starts at 13:30-14:30 (though often not until 15:00) and was once typically followed by a short siesta, usually at summer when temperatures can be quite hot in the afternoon.  This is the main meal of the day with two courses (\nel primer plato\nand\nel segundo plato\nfollowed by dessert).\nLa comida\nand siesta are usually over by 16:00 at the latest. However, since life has become busier, there is no opportunity for a siesta.\ndinner (\ncena\n) starts at 20:30 or 21:00, with most clientèle coming after 21:00. It is a lighter meal than lunch. In Madrid restaurants rarely open before 21:00 and most customers do not appear before 23:00.\nthere is also an afternoon snack that some take between\nla comida\nand\nla cena\ncalled\nmerienda\n.  It is similar to a tea time in England and is taken around 18:00 or so.\nbetween the lunch and dinner times, most restaurants and cafes are closed, and it takes extra effort to find a place to eat if you missed lunch time. Despite this, you can always look for a\nbar\nand ask for a\nbocadillo\n, a baguette sandwich. There are\nbocadillos fríos\n, cold sandwiches, which can be filled with ham,\ncheese\nor any kind of\nembutido\n, and\nbocadillos calientes\n, hot sandwiches, filled with pork loin,\ntortilla\n, bacon, sausage and similar options with cheese. This can be a really cheap and tasty option if you find a good place.\nNormally, restaurants in big cities don't close until midnight during the week and 02:00-03:00 during the weekend.\nBreakfast\n[\nedit\n]\n\"\nChocolate con churros\n\"\nBreakfast is eaten by most Spaniards. Traditional Spanish breakfast includes coffee or orange juice, and pastries or a small sandwich. In Madrid, it is also common to have hot chocolate with \"churros\" or \"porras\". In cafes, you can expect varieties of\ntortilla de patatas\n(see the\nSpanish dishes\nsection\n), sometimes tapas (either breakfast variety or same kind as served in the evenings with alcohol).\nTapas\n[\nedit\n]\nSpanish Tapas\nThe entry level to Spanish food is found in bars as\ntapas\n, which are a bit like \"starters\" or \"appetisers\", but are instead considered side orders to accompany your drink; in some parts of Spain, a drink is still accompanied automatically by a free tapa, but in places where it's not, ask for\ntapa y caña\nto order a beer and a tapa. Some bars will offer a wide variety of different tapas; others specialise on a specific kind (like seafood-based). A Spanish custom is to have one tapa and one small drink at a bar, then go to the next bar and do the same.  A group of two or more individuals may order two or more\ntapas\nor order\nraciones\ninstead, which are a bit larger in order to share.\nTypes of dishes\n[\nedit\n]\nSeafood\n(\nmariscos\n): on the coast, fresh seafood is widely available and quite affordable. In the inner regions, frozen (and poor quality) seafood can be frequently encountered outside few highly reputed (and expensive) restaurants. In coastal areas seafood deserves some attention, especially on the north Atlantic coast.\nQuality seafood in Spain comes from Spain's northwestern region of Galicia. So restaurants with the words\nGallego\n(Galician) will generally specialise in seafood. If you are feeling adventurous,  you might want to try the Galician regional specialty\nPulpo a la Gallega\n, which is boiled octopus served with paprika, rock salt and olive oil. Another adventurous option is\nSepia\nwhich is cuttlefish, a relative of squid, or the various forms of\nCalamares\n(squid) that you can find in most seafood restaurants. If that isn't your style you can always order\nGambas Ajillo\n(garlic shrimp),\nPescado Frito\n(fried fish),\nBuñuelos de Bacalao\n(breaded and deep fried cod) or the ever-present\nPaella\ndishes.\nMeat products\nare usually of very good quality, because Spain has maintained quite a high percentage of free range animals.\nOrdering beef steaks is highly recommended, since most come from free range cows from the mountains.\nPork cuts which are also highly coveted are those known as\npresa ibérica\nand\nsecreto ibérico\n, an absolute must if found in the menu of any restaurant.\nSoups\n: the choice of soups beyond gazpacho is very limited in Spanish restaurants.\nRestaurants\n[\nedit\n]\nWater\n(\nagua\n) is frequently served without a specific request, and is normally charged for, unless it's included in your\nmenu del dia\n. If you would like free tap water instead of bottled water, ask for\nagua del grifo\n. However, not all restaurants will offer this and you may be forced to order bottled water.\nAppetisers\nsuch as bread (\npan\n), cheese (\nqueso\n), and other items may be brought to your table even if you didn't order them. You may still be charged for them. If you do not want these appetisers, politely inform the waiter that you do not want them.\nWorld-famous restaurants\n: There are several restaurants in Spain which are destinations in themselves, becoming a sole reason to travel to a specific city. One of them is\nEl Celler de Can Roca\nin\nGirona\n.\nFast food\n[\nedit\n]\nFast food has not yet established a strong grip on the Spaniards and you will find McDonalds and Burger King only in bigger towns in the usual places. That said, Madrid and other large Spanish cities are often the first place for North American chains to dip their toe into the European market and you'll find Taco Bell, TGI Friday's or Five Guys there but not or only rarely in central European cities. The menu can be a surprise since it has been customised to appeal to the locals and beer, salads, yogurt (primarily Danone), and wine are prominent. Pizza is increasingly popular and you will find some outlets in bigger towns but it can be their own homegrown franchises, such as TelePizza. In spite of beer and wine on the menu, fast food is often seen as \"kiddie food.\" American franchises generally charge higher prices than in the United States, and fast food is not necessarily the cheapest alternative for eating out.\nService charges and VAT\n[\nedit\n]\nNo\nservice charges\nare included in the bill. A little extra tip is common and you are free to increase that if you are very pleased. Obviously you don't have to tip a lousy waiter. You would typically leave the small change after paying with a note.\nMenú del día\n[\nedit\n]\nMany restaurants offer a complete lunch meal for a fixed price –\nmenú del día\n– and this often works out as a bargain. Water or wine (\nvino\n) is commonly included in the price.\nNon-Spanish cuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nThings like schnitzel, full English breakfast, pizza, döner, and frozen fish are largely available in tourist destinations. In most cities you can also find international cuisine such as Italian, Chinese, French, Thai,  Japanese, Middle Eastern, Vietnamese, and Argentinian. The bigger the city, the more variety you can find.\nUnlike some northern European countries, Spain received very little immigration until after the death of Franco and the 1980s economic boom and as such there may be less variety of immigrant-owned restaurants in small- and medium-sized towns, but this is of course changing with particularly Latin American and Middle Eastern immigration to Spain leaving their mark on the restaurant scene."

Asking for\ncaffee latte\nwill likely result in less milk than you are used to—it's always OK to ask for extra milk.\nRegional variants can be found, such as\nbombón\nin Eastern Spain, solo with condensed milk.\nStarbucks\nis the only national chain operating in Spain. Locals argue that it cannot compete with small local cafes in quality of coffee and visited only by tourists. It is not present in smaller cities.\nIf you eat for €20 per dinner, you will never be served a good tea; expect Pompadour or Lipton. It takes some effort to find a good tea if you spend most time of the day in touristy places.\nHorchata\nis a milky non-alcoholic drink made of tiger nuts and sugar, and very different from drinks of the same name found in\nLatin America\n.\nAlboraia\n, a small town close to\nValencia\n, is regarded as a best place where horchata is produced.\nAlcohol\n[\nedit\n]\nThe drinking age in Spain is 18. People under this age are forbidden to drink and buy alcoholic drinks, although enforcement in tourist and clubbing areas is lax. Drinking in the streets has been banned (although it is still a common practice in most nightlife areas). A \"dry law\" bans supermarkets from selling alcohol after 22:00.\nTry an absinthe cocktail (the fabled liquor was never outlawed here, but it is not a popular drink in Spain).\nBars\n[\nedit\n]\nProbably one of the best places to meet people in Spain is in bars. Everyone visits them and they are always busy and sometimes bursting with people. There is no age restriction imposed to enter these premises, but children and teenagers often will not be served alcoholic drinks.  Age restrictions for the consumption of alcohol are clearly posted at bars but are enforced only intermittently. It is common to see an entire family at a bar.\nIt's important to know the difference between a pub (which closes at 3-03:30) and a club (which opens until 06:00-08:00 but is usually deserted early in the night).\nOn weekends, the time to go out for\ncopas\n(drinks) usually starts at about 23:00-01:00 which is somewhat later than in North and Central Europe. Before that, people usually do any number of things, have some tapas (\nraciones\n,\nalgo para picar\n), eat a \"real\" dinner in a restaurant, stay at home with family, or go to cultural events. If you want to go dancing, you will find that most of the clubs in Madrid are relatively empty before midnight (some do not even open until 01:00) and most won't get crowded until 03:00. People usually go to pubs, then go to the clubs until 06:00-08:00.\nFor a true Spanish experience, after a night of dancing and drinking it is common to have a breakfast of\nchocolate con churros\nwith your friends before going home. (\nCcC\nis a small cup of thick, melted chocolate served with freshly fried sweet fritters used for dipping in the chocolate and should be tried, if only for the great taste.)\nBars are mainly to have drink and a small\ntapa\nwhile socialising and decompressing from work or studies. Usually Spaniards can control their alcohol consumption better than their northern European neighbours and drunken people are rarely seen at bars or on the streets.  A drink, if ordered without an accompanying tapa, is often served with a \"minor\" or inexpensive tapa as a courtesy.\nSize and price of tapas changes a lot throughout Spain.

    "text": "Tea and coffee\n[\nedit\n]\nSpanish people are very passionate about the quality, intensity  and taste of their\ncoffee\n(\ncafé\n) and good freshly brewed coffee is available almost everywhere.\nThe usual choices are\nsolo\n, the milk-less espresso version;\ncortado\n, solo with a dash of milk;\ncon leche\n, solo with milk added; and\nmanchado\n, coffee with lots of milk (sort of like the French\ncafe au lait\n). Asking for\ncaffee latte\nwill likely result in less milk than you are used to—it's always OK to ask for extra milk.\nRegional variants can be found, such as\nbombón\nin Eastern Spain, solo with condensed milk.\nStarbucks\nis the only national chain operating in Spain. Locals argue that it cannot compete with small local cafes in quality of coffee and visited only by tourists. It is not present in smaller cities.\nIf you eat for €20 per dinner, you will never be served a good tea; expect Pompadour or Lipton. It takes some effort to find a good tea if you spend most time of the day in touristy places.\nHorchata\nis a milky non-alcoholic drink made of tiger nuts and sugar, and very different from drinks of the same name found in\nLatin America\n.\nAlboraia\n, a small town close to\nValencia\n, is regarded as a best place where horchata is produced."

    "text": "Bars\n[\nedit\n]\nProbably one of the best places to meet people in Spain is in bars. Everyone visits them and they are always busy and sometimes bursting with people. There is no age restriction imposed to enter these premises, but children and teenagers often will not be served alcoholic drinks.  Age restrictions for the consumption of alcohol are clearly posted at bars but are enforced only intermittently. It is common to see an entire family at a bar.\nIt's important to know the difference between a pub (which closes at 3-03:30) and a club (which opens until 06:00-08:00 but is usually deserted early in the night).\nOn weekends, the time to go out for\ncopas\n(drinks) usually starts at about 23:00-01:00 which is somewhat later than in North and Central Europe. Before that, people usually do any number of things, have some tapas (\nraciones\n,\nalgo para picar\n), eat a \"real\" dinner in a restaurant, stay at home with family, or go to cultural events. If you want to go dancing, you will find that most of the clubs in Madrid are relatively empty before midnight (some do not even open until 01:00) and most won't get crowded until 03:00. People usually go to pubs, then go to the clubs until 06:00-08:00.\nFor a true Spanish experience, after a night of dancing and drinking it is common to have a breakfast of\nchocolate con churros\nwith your friends before going home. (\nCcC\nis a small cup of thick, melted chocolate served with freshly fried sweet fritters used for dipping in the chocolate and should be tried, if only for the great taste.)\nBars are mainly to have drink and a small\ntapa\nwhile socialising and decompressing from work or studies. Usually Spaniards can control their alcohol consumption better than their northern European neighbours and drunken people are rarely seen at bars or on the streets.  A drink, if ordered without an accompanying tapa, is often served with a \"minor\" or inexpensive tapa as a courtesy.\nSize and price of tapas changes a lot throughout Spain. For instance, it's almost impossible to get free tapas in big cities like Valencia or Barcelona, excluding Madrid where there are several Tapa Bars although some are a bit expensive. You can eat for free (just paying for the drinks), with huge tapas and cheap prices at cities like Granada, Badajoz or Salamanca.\nThe tapa, and the related pincho, trace their existence in Spain to both acting as a cover (\"Tapa\") on top of a cup of wine to prevent flies from accessing it, and as a requirement of law when serving wine at an establishment during the Middle Ages."

    "text": "Stay safe\n[\nedit\n]\nAs per rest of the\nEuropean Union\n, all emergencies can be reported to the toll-free number\n112\n.\nPolice\n[\nedit\n]\nPolice car of the National Police\nPolice car of the Guardia Civil\nThere are four kinds of police in Spain:\nPolicía Municipal\nor\nLocal\n(municipal/local police), In\nBarcelona\n: Guardia Urbana. Uniforms change from town to town, but they usually wear black or blue clothes with pale blue shirt and a blue cap (or white helmet) with a checkered white-and-blue strip. Local police keeps order and rules the traffic inside cities, and they can help in case you are lost and need some directions. Although you can't directly report\ncrimes\nto them, they will escort you to the local\nPolicia Nacional\nheadquarters if required, and they will escort the suspects to be arrested also, if needed.\nPolicía Nacional\n(National Police) wear dark blue clothes and blue cap (sometimes replaced by a baseball-like cap), unlike Policía Municipal, they do not have a checkered flag around their cap/helmet. Inside cities, all offenses/crimes should be reported to them, although the other police forces would help anyone who needs to report an offense.\nGuardia Civil\n(Civil Guard) keeps the order outside cities, in the country, and regulates traffic in the roads between cities. You would probably see them guarding official buildings, or patrolling the roads. They wear plain green military-like uniform; for ceremonial duties, officers wear a black hat (\ntricornio\n) resembling a toreador cap, a tradition dated back to the 19th century, but most of them use green caps or white motorcycle helmets. The Guardia Civil likes to project a \"tough guy\" image and they are sometimes accused of excessive use of force.\nGiven that Spain has a high grade of political autonomy granted to its regional governments, four of them have created regional law forces: the Policía Foral in Navarre, the Ertzaintza in the Basque Country, the Policía Canaria on the Canary Islands or the Mossos d'Esquadra in Catalonia. These forces have the almost the same competences as the Policía Nacional in their respective territories. Additionally there is BESCAM (Brigadas Especiales de Seguridad de la Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid) in the Madrid region which sit somewhere between local police and a fully autonomous police of an autonomous region but carry their own uniforms and livery on vehicles.\nAll kinds of police also wear high-visibility clothing (\"reflective\" jackets) while directing traffic, or in the road.\nSome thieves have been known to pose as police officers, asking to see wallets for identification purposes. If approached by someone claiming to be a police officer only show only your ID after the person has presented theirs; do not show your wallet or other valuables.\nIf you are a victim of crime call 112. You can ask for a copy of the “denuncia” (police report) if you need it for insurance purposes, or to apply for replacement documents.  Make sure that it is a “una denuncia” not a sworn declaration (una declaración judicial), as the latter may not be accepted as evidence of the crime for insurance purposes, or when applying for your new passport.\nMaking a police report\n[\nedit\n]\nYou can make a police report in three different ways:\n1. In person.  A list of police stations in the different regions of Spain is available here. English language interpreters are not always available at short notice: it may be advisable to bring a Spanish-speaking person with you.\n2. By telephone: You can make a police report by phone in English\n☏\n+34 901 102 112\n. The English language service is available 09:00-21:00, seven days a week. Once you have made your report, you will be instructed to pick up a signed copy of the report at your nearest police station. However, some crimes, particularly more serious crimes or those involving violence, can only be reported in person.\n3. Online: You can also make a police report online, but in Spanish only. Some crimes, especially more serious crimes involving physical violence, must be reported in person.\nPermissions and documentation\n[\nedit\n]\nSpanish law\nstrictly requires foreigners who are in Spanish territory to have documentation proving their identity and the fact of being legally in Spain. You must have that with you all the time because you may be asked by the Police to show those at any moment. If you don't carry it with you, you may be escorted to the nearest police station for identification.\nSafety\n[\nedit\n]\nSpain is a safe country, but there are certain security risks specific to Spain.\nLarge cities like Alicante, Barcelona, Madrid, and Sevilla, in particular, report many incidents of pick-pocketing, mugging, and violent attacks, some of which require the victim to seek medical attention. Although crimes occur at all times of day and night and to people of all ages, older and Asian tourists seem to be particularly at risk.\nIn Madrid and also in Barcelona, criminals often target people from East Asia (especially China, S. Korea, Japan, and Taiwan), thinking they carry money and are easy prey.\nView of Barcelona\nBeware of\npickpockets\nand thieves, especially in Madrid and Barcelona.\nTheft from rental vehicles is high. Be vigilant in service areas on the highways along the coast. Avoid leaving any luggage or valuables in the vehicle and use secure parking facilities.\nAvoid women offering rosemary, refuse it always; they will read your future, ask for some money, and your pocket will probably be picked. Some women will also approach you on the street repeating \"Buena suerte\" (\"good luck\") as a distraction for another woman to try to pickpocket you.\nMore foreign passports are stolen each year in Spain than anywhere else in the world, especially in Barcelona. Ensure that your passport is protected at all times.\nIn the event of a road-related incident, exercise extreme caution and do not accept help from anyone other than a uniformed Spanish police officer or Civil Guard in a marked vehicle. Thieves in Spain have been known to fake or provoke a flat tire on their own vehicles, and when a motorist stops to help them, the thieves steal the motorist's car or belongings. The reverse scenario has also occurred, whereby a fake Good Samaritan stops to help a motorist in distress, only to steal the motorist's car or belongings. There have been reports of thieves damaging rental cars departing major cities (especially Barcelona) in order to induce flat tires in rural areas where tourists can be more easily attacked.\nScams\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nCommon scams\nSome people could try to take advantage of your ignorance of local customs.\nIn Spanish cities, all taxis should have a visible fare table. Do not agree a fixed price to go from an airport to a city: in most cases, the taxi driver will be earning more money than without a preagreed tariff. Many taxi drivers will also demand a tip from foreign customers or even from national ones on the way to and from the airport. You might round up to the nearest euro when paying though.\nIn many places of Madrid, especially near Atocha station, and also in the Ramblas of\nBarcelona\n, there are people ('trileros') who play the \"shell game\". They will \"fish\" you if you play, and they will most likely pick your pocket if you stop to see other people play.\nBefore paying the bill in bars and restaurants, always check the bill and carefully scrutinise it. Some staff will often attempt to squeeze a few extra euros out of unsuspecting tourists by charging for things they did not eat or drink, or simply overcharging. This is true in both touristy and non-touristy areas. If you feel overcharged, bring it to their attention and/or ask to see a menu. It is also sometimes written (in English only) at the bottom of a bill that a tip is not included: remember that tipping is optional in Spain and Spanish people commonly leave loose change only and no more than a 5%–8% of the price of what they have consumed (not an American-style 15–20%), so avoid being fooled into leaving more.\nMany tourists have reported lottery scams whereby they are contacted via the Internet or fax and informed that they have won a substantial prize in the Spanish lottery (El Gordo), when in fact they have never participated in the lottery. They are asked to deposit an amount of money in a bank account to pay taxes and other fees before collecting the prize or coming to Spain to close the transaction.\nThere have also been reports of a scam whereby a person is informed that he or she is the recipient of a large inheritance, and that funds must be deposited into a Spanish bank account so the inheritance can be processed.\nIn another common scam, some tourists have received a bogus email purportedly sent from an individual well known to them and claiming that he or she is in trouble and needs funds.\nOther things you should know\n[\nedit\n]\nSpanish cities can be\nloud at night\n, especially on weekends, but the streets are generally safe even for women.\nAll businesses should have an official\ncomplaint form\n, in case you need it. It is\nillegal\nfor a business to deny you this form.\nIn some cases, police in Spain may target people belonging to ethnic minorities for\nidentity checks\n. People who are not \"European-looking\" can be stopped several times a day to have their papers checked on the pretext of \"migration control\".\nThere has been an increase in political action and\npublic demonstrations\non a rolling basis throughout Spain. Demonstrations occur and have sometimes turned violent, mostly to police officers. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media. Strikes may occasionally lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. When a demonstration is planned or in progress you should seek advice on and avoid the routes marchers plan to take. You should also ensure to check for travel updates or transport delays before and during your trip to Spain.\nEvening rush in Madrid\nDriving\nin Spain can be dangerous due to traffic congestion in urban areas, although driving is not particularly aggressive with the exception of common speeding. Be cautious when driving in Spain. Night driving can be particularly dangerous. The use of a mobile phone without a hands-free device can result in a fine and you being banned from driving in Spain. All drivers are required to carry, in the vehicle, a reflective vest and to use a reflective triangle warning sign if they need to stop at the roadside.\nBe cautious when approached by someone who\nclaims to be a police\nofficer. On the road, you will always be stopped by an officer in a uniform. Unmarked vehicles will have a flashing electronic sign on the rear window which reads\nPolicía\nor\nGuardia Civil\n, and either\nErtzaintza\nif in the Basque Country, or\nMossos d'Esquadra\nif in Catalonia, or\nForuzaingoa/Policía Foral\nin Navarre. Most times they will have blue flashing lights incorporated into the headlights. In non-traffic-related matters police officers may be in casual clothes. Police officers do not have to directly identify themselves unless you ask them to. Should they request identification, they should be shown photographic ID. Your passport or your driver's licence will do, or your national ID card if you are from the European Union, though a passport is always preferred. You can get in trouble or be fined for not having any identification on you. If in any doubt, drivers should converse through the car window and contact the Guardia Civil on 062 or the Spanish National Police on 112 and ask them to confirm that the registration number of the vehicle corresponds to an official police vehicle.\nDrugs\n[\nedit\n]\nYou can smell marijuana smoke at many street corners in major cities with police apparently unperturbed by it. Still, if you don't know local customs, it is quite possible that the police make a show of enforcing the law on you.\nThe consumption of alcoholic beverages in the street, or when it seriously disrupts public tranquillity is fined up to €600.\nThese rules are actively enforced."

    "text": "Police\n[\nedit\n]\nPolice car of the National Police\nPolice car of the Guardia Civil\nThere are four kinds of police in Spain:\nPolicía Municipal\nor\nLocal\n(municipal/local police), In\nBarcelona\n: Guardia Urbana. Uniforms change from town to town, but they usually wear black or blue clothes with pale blue shirt and a blue cap (or white helmet) with a checkered white-and-blue strip. Local police keeps order and rules the traffic inside cities, and they can help in case you are lost and need some directions. Although you can't directly report\ncrimes\nto them, they will escort you to the local\nPolicia Nacional\nheadquarters if required, and they will escort the suspects to be arrested also, if needed.\nPolicía Nacional\n(National Police) wear dark blue clothes and blue cap (sometimes replaced by a baseball-like cap), unlike Policía Municipal, they do not have a checkered flag around their cap/helmet. Inside cities, all offenses/crimes should be reported to them, although the other police forces would help anyone who needs to report an offense.\nGuardia Civil\n(Civil Guard) keeps the order outside cities, in the country, and regulates traffic in the roads between cities. You would probably see them guarding official buildings, or patrolling the roads. They wear plain green military-like uniform; for ceremonial duties, officers wear a black hat (\ntricornio\n) resembling a toreador cap, a tradition dated back to the 19th century, but most of them use green caps or white motorcycle helmets. The Guardia Civil likes to project a \"tough guy\" image and they are sometimes accused of excessive use of force.\nGiven that Spain has a high grade of political autonomy granted to its regional governments, four of them have created regional law forces: the Policía Foral in Navarre, the Ertzaintza in the Basque Country, the Policía Canaria on the Canary Islands or the Mossos d'Esquadra in Catalonia. These forces have the almost the same competences as the Policía Nacional in their respective territories. Additionally there is BESCAM (Brigadas Especiales de Seguridad de la Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid) in the Madrid region which sit somewhere between local police and a fully autonomous police of an autonomous region but carry their own uniforms and livery on vehicles.\nAll kinds of police also wear high-visibility clothing (\"reflective\" jackets) while directing traffic, or in the road.\nSome thieves have been known to pose as police officers, asking to see wallets for identification purposes. If approached by someone claiming to be a police officer only show only your ID after the person has presented theirs; do not show your wallet or other valuables.\nIf you are a victim of crime call 112. You can ask for a copy of the “denuncia” (police report) if you need it for insurance purposes, or to apply for replacement documents.  Make sure that it is a “una denuncia” not a sworn declaration (una declaración judicial), as the latter may not be accepted as evidence of the crime for insurance purposes, or when applying for your new passport.\nMaking a police report\n[\nedit\n]\nYou can make a police report in three different ways:\n1. In person.  A list of police stations in the different regions of Spain is available here. English language interpreters are not always available at short notice: it may be advisable to bring a Spanish-speaking person with you.\n2. By telephone: You can make a police report by phone in English\n☏\n+34 901 102 112\n. The English language service is available 09:00-21:00, seven days a week. Once you have made your report, you will be instructed to pick up a signed copy of the report at your nearest police station. However, some crimes, particularly more serious crimes or those involving violence, can only be reported in person.\n3. Online: You can also make a police report online, but in Spanish only. Some crimes, especially more serious crimes involving physical violence, must be reported in person."

    "text": "Safety\n[\nedit\n]\nSpain is a safe country, but there are certain security risks specific to Spain.\nLarge cities like Alicante, Barcelona, Madrid, and Sevilla, in particular, report many incidents of pick-pocketing, mugging, and violent attacks, some of which require the victim to seek medical attention. Although crimes occur at all times of day and night and to people of all ages, older and Asian tourists seem to be particularly at risk.\nIn Madrid and also in Barcelona, criminals often target people from East Asia (especially China, S. Korea, Japan, and Taiwan), thinking they carry money and are easy prey.\nView of Barcelona\nBeware of\npickpockets\nand thieves, especially in Madrid and Barcelona.\nTheft from rental vehicles is high. Be vigilant in service areas on the highways along the coast. Avoid leaving any luggage or valuables in the vehicle and use secure parking facilities.\nAvoid women offering rosemary, refuse it always; they will read your future, ask for some money, and your pocket will probably be picked. Some women will also approach you on the street repeating \"Buena suerte\" (\"good luck\") as a distraction for another woman to try to pickpocket you.\nMore foreign passports are stolen each year in Spain than anywhere else in the world, especially in Barcelona. Ensure that your passport is protected at all times.\nIn the event of a road-related incident, exercise extreme caution and do not accept help from anyone other than a uniformed Spanish police officer or Civil Guard in a marked vehicle. Thieves in Spain have been known to fake or provoke a flat tire on their own vehicles, and when a motorist stops to help them, the thieves steal the motorist's car or belongings. The reverse scenario has also occurred, whereby a fake Good Samaritan stops to help a motorist in distress, only to steal the motorist's car or belongings. There have been reports of thieves damaging rental cars departing major cities (especially Barcelona) in order to induce flat tires in rural areas where tourists can be more easily attacked."

    "text": "Scams\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nCommon scams\nSome people could try to take advantage of your ignorance of local customs.\nIn Spanish cities, all taxis should have a visible fare table. Do not agree a fixed price to go from an airport to a city: in most cases, the taxi driver will be earning more money than without a preagreed tariff. Many taxi drivers will also demand a tip from foreign customers or even from national ones on the way to and from the airport. You might round up to the nearest euro when paying though.\nIn many places of Madrid, especially near Atocha station, and also in the Ramblas of\nBarcelona\n, there are people ('trileros') who play the \"shell game\". They will \"fish\" you if you play, and they will most likely pick your pocket if you stop to see other people play.\nBefore paying the bill in bars and restaurants, always check the bill and carefully scrutinise it. Some staff will often attempt to squeeze a few extra euros out of unsuspecting tourists by charging for things they did not eat or drink, or simply overcharging. This is true in both touristy and non-touristy areas. If you feel overcharged, bring it to their attention and/or ask to see a menu. It is also sometimes written (in English only) at the bottom of a bill that a tip is not included: remember that tipping is optional in Spain and Spanish people commonly leave loose change only and no more than a 5%–8% of the price of what they have consumed (not an American-style 15–20%), so avoid being fooled into leaving more.\nMany tourists have reported lottery scams whereby they are contacted via the Internet or fax and informed that they have won a substantial prize in the Spanish lottery (El Gordo), when in fact they have never participated in the lottery. They are asked to deposit an amount of money in a bank account to pay taxes and other fees before collecting the prize or coming to Spain to close the transaction.\nThere have also been reports of a scam whereby a person is informed that he or she is the recipient of a large inheritance, and that funds must be deposited into a Spanish bank account so the inheritance can be processed.\nIn another common scam, some tourists have received a bogus email purportedly sent from an individual well known to them and claiming that he or she is in trouble and needs funds."

    "text": "Other things you should know\n[\nedit\n]\nSpanish cities can be\nloud at night\n, especially on weekends, but the streets are generally safe even for women.\nAll businesses should have an official\ncomplaint form\n, in case you need it. It is\nillegal\nfor a business to deny you this form.\nIn some cases, police in Spain may target people belonging to ethnic minorities for\nidentity checks\n. People who are not \"European-looking\" can be stopped several times a day to have their papers checked on the pretext of \"migration control\".\nThere has been an increase in political action and\npublic demonstrations\non a rolling basis throughout Spain. Demonstrations occur and have sometimes turned violent, mostly to police officers. Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media. Strikes may occasionally lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. When a demonstration is planned or in progress you should seek advice on and avoid the routes marchers plan to take. You should also ensure to check for travel updates or transport delays before and during your trip to Spain.\nEvening rush in Madrid\nDriving\nin Spain can be dangerous due to traffic congestion in urban areas, although driving is not particularly aggressive with the exception of common speeding. Be cautious when driving in Spain. Night driving can be particularly dangerous. The use of a mobile phone without a hands-free device can result in a fine and you being banned from driving in Spain. All drivers are required to carry, in the vehicle, a reflective vest and to use a reflective triangle warning sign if they need to stop at the roadside.\nBe cautious when approached by someone who\nclaims to be a police\nofficer. On the road, you will always be stopped by an officer in a uniform. Unmarked vehicles will have a flashing electronic sign on the rear window which reads\nPolicía\nor\nGuardia Civil\n, and either\nErtzaintza\nif in the Basque Country, or\nMossos d'Esquadra\nif in Catalonia, or\nForuzaingoa/Policía Foral\nin Navarre. Most times they will have blue flashing lights incorporated into the headlights. In non-traffic-related matters police officers may be in casual clothes. Police officers do not have to directly identify themselves unless you ask them to. Should they request identification, they should be shown photographic ID. Your passport or your driver's licence will do, or your national ID card if you are from the European Union, though a passport is always preferred. You can get in trouble or be fined for not having any identification on you. If in any doubt, drivers should converse through the car window and contact the Guardia Civil on 062 or the Spanish National Police on 112 and ask them to confirm that the registration number of the vehicle corresponds to an official police vehicle."

    "text": "Respect\n[\nedit\n]\nGenerally speaking, Spaniards are widely regarded as welcoming and friendly.\nCulture and identity\n[\nedit\n]\nSpaniards are generally\nneutral communicators\n. They're comfortable with expressing their opinions and emotions on something, and they expect the same from you. While this may give you the impression that Spanish people are confident and sociable, you should make every effort to be tactful with your words as they are sensitive to being beckoned directly.\nIn conversational settings, it is common for people to interrupt or talk over one another. Shouting to make oneself heard is common, as is the use of swear words. You may also find that it is common for people to give you advice on all kinds of things. For instance, you can expect people to tell you what to see and where to go. At first, this may come across as annoying, but the information that Spaniards provide is meant to help you in a good way, not lay traps for you.\nFamily values are important to many Spaniards. Passing unwarranted comments and/or criticisms about someone's family members is considered rude.\nSpaniards, especially the young, generally feel a linguistic and cultural connection to Latin America. However, most will be quick to point out that Spain is a European nation, not a Latin American one and that all Spanish-speaking countries are different and have particularities of their own.\nSpaniards are not as religious as the media sometimes presents them, and modern Spanish society is for the most part rather secular, but they are and always were a mostly Catholic country (73% officially, although only 10% admit practising and only 20% admit being believers); respect this and avoid making any comments that could offend. In particular, religious festivals, Holy Week (Easter), and Christmas are very important to Spaniards, and the monarch is still constitutionally required to be a Catholic. Tolerance of all religions should be observed, especially in large urban areas like Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville or Malaga (where people and temples of all beliefs can be found) or different regions in southern Spain, which may have a sizable Muslim population (which accounts for almost 4% of the country's population).\nThe rainbow flag on Madrid's city hall\nDespite being a Catholic majority country,\nhomosexuality\nis quite tolerated in Spain and public display of same-sex affection would not likely stir hostility. A 2013 Pew survey of various countries in the Americas, Europe, Africa and the Middle East found that Spain had the highest percentage of people who believed homosexuality should be accepted by society, at 88%. Same-sex marriage has been legal since 2005 and the government provides legal benefits to same-sex couples. However, this does not always necessarily mean that all Spaniards are friendly to gays; while homophobic aggressions are rare, they still happen. Cities are more tolerant of homosexuality than rural areas, Madrid, Catalonia and the Basque Country are much more tolerant but overall Spain is gay-friendly. As in any other place, elderly people do usually have far more conservative points of view. The Madrid pride parade is one of the largest in the world. Overall, Spain is one of the safest countries for LGBT tourists.\nAvoid talking about the former colonial past and especially about the \"Black Legend.\" Regardless of what you may have heard Spain had several ministers and military leaders of mixed race serving in the military during the colonial era and even a Prime Minister born in the Philippines (Marcelo Azcarraga Palmero). Many Spaniards take pride in their history and former imperial glories. People from Spain's former colonies (Latin America, Equatorial Guinea, the Philippines, Western Sahara and Northern Morocco) make up a majority of foreign immigrants in Spain (58%) along with the Chinese, Africans and Eastern Europeans. Equally, Spain is one of the main investors and economic and humanitarian aid donors to Latin America and Africa.\nBullfighting\n(Spanish:\nTauromaquia\n) is seen by many Spaniards as a cultural heritage icon, but the disaffection with bullfighting is increasing in all big cities and obviously among animal activist groups within the country. Many urban Spaniards would consider bullfighting a show aimed at foreign tourists and elderly people from the countryside, and some young Spaniards will feel offended if their country is associated with it. To illustrate how divided the country is, many Spaniards point to the royal family: former king Juan Carlos and his daughter are avid fans, while his wife and son King Felipe VI do not care for the sport. Bullfights and related events, such as the annual San Fermin Pamplona bull-runs, make up a multi-million euro industry and draw many tourists, both foreign and Spanish. In addition, bullfighting has been banned in the northeastern region of Catalonia as well as in several towns and counties all over the country.\nTake care when mentioning the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who ruled Spain from 1939 to 1975 as well as the Civil War of 1936–1939. This was a painful past as Franco ruled Spain with an iron fist, executing many Spaniards who violated the anti-democratic laws of the regime. It was also a notable period of economic growth in the final years of Franco's regime, and some older Spaniards may have supportive views of him. The Republican flag (red, yellow, purple, either with or without a coat of arms) can be seen hanging from balconies and bought at some souvenir shops. However, it is not an uncontroversial symbol and associated with leftism, often showing up at leftist demonstrations. No symbols from the Franco era are officially forbidden, but using or displaying them is associated with far right extremists.\nThe possibilities of\nCatalan\nindependence,\nBasque\nindependence, and\nGalician\nindependence are extremely sensitive issues among many in Spain. You should avoid discussing them where possible. If anything surrounding these subjects is brought up by someone, it's best to stay neutral.\nVirtually everyone in Spain, regardless of region, is able to speak\nCastilian Spanish\n, albeit not always as a mother tongue. In Catalonia, some Catalans prefer to not speak Spanish at all, and will reply to Spanish-speaking interlocutors in Catalan; this is usually a political statement, rather than a lack of Castilian language ability. Foreigners are given a bit more leeway, but there are still some Catalans who'd rather have a conversation in English than Spanish if those are the only options for communication. While many Spaniards from Castilla consider Catalan to be a dialect of Spanish, Catalans consider it to be a separate language in its own right.\nThe political status of Gibraltar is a particularly sensitive issue. Most Spaniards consider Gibraltar to be Spanish sovereign territory that is illegally occupied by Britain. Most Gibraltarians on the other hand are both proud Brits and proud Europeans - a situation made infinitely more awkward by Brexit which passed against near unanimous Gibraltarian opposition.\nAvoid discussing the Spanish monarchy. Many are generally opposed to the Spanish royal family, although there are some who are staunchly monarchist. Due to the Bourbon dynasty's identification with centralism, supporters of Catalan and Basque independence often don't have a good word to say about them.\nSocialising\n[\nedit\n]\nIt is customary to kiss friends, family, and acquaintances on both cheeks upon seeing each other and saying goodbye. Male-to-male kisses of this sort are limited to family members or to very close friends; otherwise a firm handshake is expected instead (as is the same in France or Italy).\nSpaniards are keen to maintain physical contact while talking, such as putting a hand on your shoulder, patting your back, etc. These should be taken as signs of friendship done among relatives, close friends and colleagues.\nSpaniards will probably feel comfortable around you more quickly than other Europeans and you may even be receive an offensive comment or even an insult (\ncabrón\n) for a greeting shortly after meeting someone in an informal environment, especially if it is a young person or a male. You should not feel offended by this, as it is interpreted as proof that you have such a close relationship that you can mess with each other without repercussions.\nYou should reply with a similar comment (never anything serious or something that will genuinely hurt the person) or just greet them. Do not go around insulting people, though, as you will also find people who do not like it. It is recommended that you never do this first as a foreigner and just wait until you get it. Generally, your instinct will be able to distinguish between a joke and a genuine aggression.\nWhen in a car, the elderly and pregnant always ride in the passenger's seat, unless they request not to.\nSpaniards are not as punctual as Northern Europeans, but generally you are expected to arrive no more than ten minutes late, and being punctual will always be received positively. It is especially important to be punctual the first time you meet with someone. As a rule of thumb, you should expect people to be more punctual as you go north and less punctual as you go south.\nIf you are staying at a Spaniard's home, bring shoes to wear inside such as slippers. Walking around barefoot in the house is viewed as unsanitary. Walking in socks may be acceptable in a close friend's house, but you should always ask first.\nIt is acceptable for women to\nsunbathe topless\nin beaches, but full nudity is only practised in \"clothing-optional\" or nudist beaches.\nEating and drinking\n[\nedit\n]\nDuring lunch or dinner, Spaniards do not begin eating until everyone is seated and ready to eat. Likewise, they do not leave the table until everyone is finished eating. Table manners are otherwise standard and informal, although this also depends on the place you are eating. When the bill comes, it is common to pay equally, regardless of the amount or price each has consumed (\npagar a escote\n).\nWhen Spaniards receive a gift or are offered a drink or a meal, they usually refuse for a while, so as not to seem greedy. This sometimes sparks arguments among especially reluctant people, but it is seen as polite. Remember to offer more than once (on the third try, it must be fairly clear if they will accept it or not). On the other hand, if you are interested in the offer, politely smile and decline it, saying that you don't want to be a nuisance, etc., but relent and accept when they insist.\nSpaniards rarely drink or eat in the street. Bars will rarely offer the option of food to take away but \"tapas\" are easily available. Taking leftovers home from a restaurant is uncommon but has somewhat less of a stigma than it used to. One asks for \"un taper\" (derived from \"Tupperware\") or \"una caja.\" Older Spaniards are still likely to frown on this. Appearing drunk in public is generally frowned upon."

Bullfights and related events, such as the annual San Fermin Pamplona bull-runs, make up a multi-million euro industry and draw many tourists, both foreign and Spanish. In addition, bullfighting has been banned in the northeastern region of Catalonia as well as in several towns and counties all over the country.\nTake care when mentioning the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who ruled Spain from 1939 to 1975 as well as the Civil War of 1936–1939. This was a painful past as Franco ruled Spain with an iron fist, executing many Spaniards who violated the anti-democratic laws of the regime. It was also a notable period of economic growth in the final years of Franco's regime, and some older Spaniards may have supportive views of him. The Republican flag (red, yellow, purple, either with or without a coat of arms) can be seen hanging from balconies and bought at some souvenir shops. However, it is not an uncontroversial symbol and associated with leftism, often showing up at leftist demonstrations. No symbols from the Franco era are officially forbidden, but using or displaying them is associated with far right extremists.\nThe possibilities of\nCatalan\nindependence,\nBasque\nindependence, and\nGalician\nindependence are extremely sensitive issues among many in Spain. You should avoid discussing them where possible. If anything surrounding these subjects is brought up by someone, it's best to stay neutral.\nVirtually everyone in Spain, regardless of region, is able to speak\nCastilian Spanish\n, albeit not always as a mother tongue. In Catalonia, some Catalans prefer to not speak Spanish at all, and will reply to Spanish-speaking interlocutors in Catalan; this is usually a political statement, rather than a lack of Castilian language ability. Foreigners are given a bit more leeway, but there are still some Catalans who'd rather have a conversation in English than Spanish if those are the only options for communication. While many Spaniards from Castilla consider Catalan to be a dialect of Spanish, Catalans consider it to be a separate language in its own right.\nThe political status of Gibraltar is a particularly sensitive issue. Most Spaniards consider Gibraltar to be Spanish sovereign territory that is illegally occupied by Britain. Most Gibraltarians on the other hand are both proud Brits and proud Europeans - a situation made infinitely more awkward by Brexit which passed against near unanimous Gibraltarian opposition.\nAvoid discussing the Spanish monarchy. Many are generally opposed to the Spanish royal family, although there are some who are staunchly monarchist. Due to the Bourbon dynasty's identification with centralism, supporters of Catalan and Basque independence often don't have a good word to say about them."

    "text": "Socialising\n[\nedit\n]\nIt is customary to kiss friends, family, and acquaintances on both cheeks upon seeing each other and saying goodbye. Male-to-male kisses of this sort are limited to family members or to very close friends; otherwise a firm handshake is expected instead (as is the same in France or Italy).\nSpaniards are keen to maintain physical contact while talking, such as putting a hand on your shoulder, patting your back, etc. These should be taken as signs of friendship done among relatives, close friends and colleagues.\nSpaniards will probably feel comfortable around you more quickly than other Europeans and you may even be receive an offensive comment or even an insult (\ncabrón\n) for a greeting shortly after meeting someone in an informal environment, especially if it is a young person or a male. You should not feel offended by this, as it is interpreted as proof that you have such a close relationship that you can mess with each other without repercussions.\nYou should reply with a similar comment (never anything serious or something that will genuinely hurt the person) or just greet them. Do not go around insulting people, though, as you will also find people who do not like it. It is recommended that you never do this first as a foreigner and just wait until you get it. Generally, your instinct will be able to distinguish between a joke and a genuine aggression.\nWhen in a car, the elderly and pregnant always ride in the passenger's seat, unless they request not to.\nSpaniards are not as punctual as Northern Europeans, but generally you are expected to arrive no more than ten minutes late, and being punctual will always be received positively. It is especially important to be punctual the first time you meet with someone. As a rule of thumb, you should expect people to be more punctual as you go north and less punctual as you go south.\nIf you are staying at a Spaniard's home, bring shoes to wear inside such as slippers. Walking around barefoot in the house is viewed as unsanitary. Walking in socks may be acceptable in a close friend's house, but you should always ask first.\nIt is acceptable for women to\nsunbathe topless\nin beaches, but full nudity is only practised in \"clothing-optional\" or nudist beaches."

Likewise, they do not leave the table until everyone is finished eating. Table manners are otherwise standard and informal, although this also depends on the place you are eating. When the bill comes, it is common to pay equally, regardless of the amount or price each has consumed (\npagar a escote\n).\nWhen Spaniards receive a gift or are offered a drink or a meal, they usually refuse for a while, so as not to seem greedy. This sometimes sparks arguments among especially reluctant people, but it is seen as polite. Remember to offer more than once (on the third try, it must be fairly clear if they will accept it or not). On the other hand, if you are interested in the offer, politely smile and decline it, saying that you don't want to be a nuisance, etc., but relent and accept when they insist.\nSpaniards rarely drink or eat in the street. Bars will rarely offer the option of food to take away but \"tapas\" are easily available. Taking leftovers home from a restaurant is uncommon but has somewhat less of a stigma than it used to. One asks for \"un taper\" (derived from \"Tupperware\") or \"una caja.\" Older Spaniards are still likely to frown on this. Appearing drunk in public is generally frowned upon."

This explains why among Spaniards, lunch time is usually between 13:00 and 14:30 (it could be as late as 15:15) while dinner time is between 20:30 and 21:30. At special celebrations, dinner can be as late as 22:00. Lunch is considered the biggest and most important meal of the day.\nIf you see a restaurant serving breakfast at 7:00, lunch at 12:00 and dinner at 18:00, it may be a tourist trap targeting British and American tourists. The same can be said for restaurants serving paella for dinner, since the dish is traditionally served for lunch.\nAlmost all small businesses close between 14:30 and 17:00, so plan your shopping and sight-seeing accordingly. Shopping malls and supermarkets, however, are usually open from 09:30 to 21:00 or 22:00, and in the larger cities several shops are open 24 hours daily, usually owned by Chinese immigrants.\nSpanish cities can be noisy in some areas; you might want to check before booking a room."

While the Old City's street plan consists of narrow winding alleys connecting large plazas, newer areas of Cadiz typically have wide avenues and more modern buildings. In addition, the city is dotted with numerous parks where exotic plants flourish, including giant trees supposedly brought to Spain by Columbus from the New World.\nIn 2019, the city had about 117,000 residents.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nCádiz is the oldest continuously inhabited city in the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in all southwestern Europe. Traditionally, its founding is dated to 1104 BC.\nThe city was founded by\nPhoenicians\nfrom Tyre, who called it\nGadir\n. Over the years the city changed hands (and names!) many times. It was inhabited by the\nRomans\n, destroyed by the Visigoths, rebuilt by the Byzantines, and occupied by the Moors until they were removed in 1262 AD by the Spanish.\nChristopher Columbus sailed from Cádiz on his second and fourth voyages, and the city later became the home port of the Spanish treasure fleet.\nIn the 18th century, it became one of Spain's greatest and most cosmopolitan cities and home to trading communities from many countries. Many of today's historic buildings in the Old City date from this era.\nThe city has undergone much reconstruction. Many monuments, cathedrals, and landmarks have been cleaned and restored, adding to the charm of this ancient city.\nClimate\n[\nedit\n]\nCádiz has a Mediterranean climate with very mild winters and warm to hot summers. Cádiz one of the sunniest cities in Europe with more than above 3000 hours of sun a year. Although summer nights are tropical in nature, daytime temperatures are comparatively subdued compared to nearby inland areas such as\nJerez\nand the very hot far inland areas in Andalusia."

In the first century AD the Romans established a town on an easily-fortified outcrop, and built the magnificent aqueduct to bring in water across the valley below.

Christian leaders sought symbols of cultural identity to rally and unite this isolated region of fishermen and subsistence farmers, with its coastline littered with scallop shells. It would also help, in an era when pilgrimage to Jerusalem was closed off, if there was some icon or relic as a focus. They cast around and landed a whopper.\nJames, cousin of Jesus, was a fisherman in Galilee and together with his brother John (author of St John's Gospel) was among the Apostles. In 44 AD King Herod Agrippa had him beheaded in Jerusalem, where he almost certainly lies; Peter was thrown in jail but busted out by an angel. As the first martyr James became revered, especially in Spain where he was known as Iacobus or Iago, hence Santiago. A story grew up that he'd preached in Spain, with the Virgin Mary coming down to perch on a pillar in Zaragoza and bless him, before he had to rush back so as not to be late for his beheading. The angels then contrived for his decapitated body to sail away in an unattended boat to Iria Flavia, now the town of Padrón 20 km south of Santiago city.\nIria Flavia was a much older religious centre, with a Roman shrine and before that a Celtic, and James was reputed to have preached there, so that's where any angelically-transported remains should belong. But the 9th century saw an ecclesiastical upheaval in which Santiago supplanted Iria Flavia. Conveniently, Pelagius the Hermit then beheld showers of stars descending upon a grave in the forest later dubbed the \"field of stars\",\ncampus stella\n. He fetched the bishop, who revealed an unexpected talent for forensic archaeology and declared the three bodies there to be James and his disciples Theodore and Athanasius. King and Pope swiftly got in on the act, a chapel then a cathedral were erected on the spot, and Santiago was acclaimed a Holy City surpassed only by Rome and Jerusalem.\nIt's been a pilgrimage destination ever since. Pilgrims initially brought home a symbolic scallop shell, then later they wore a shell on their outbound quest and were awarded a written certificate. The Lutheran / Protestant movement long scorned the whole business but an ecumenical spirit in the 20th century led to recognition of the value of pilgrimage, emphasising the physical and spiritual personal journey and downplaying the legends and physical icons.\nSt James was invoked to help in various battles: he somehow failed to repel Napoleon, but in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) the falangists were great supporters of his cult and held the city from the outset. After Franco's death in 1975, Spain transitioned to a constitutional monarchy, tourism (including religious tourism) flourished, and Santiago de Compostela was declared capital city of Galicia.\nClimate\nof Santiago is typical of the Iberian Atlantic coast: wet winters, and frequent downpours from September to June. Summers are mild.\nSantiago Turismo\nis the online visitor portal. The tourist office is 200 m south of the cathedral at Rúa do Vilar 63, open daily 109:00-18:00."

Today you can still admire the city’s Forum, Thermal Baths, the River Port or the Great Theatre, archeological remains which reflect the splendour of the city as it was during the\nRoman Empire\n. It was on the banks of the river Ebro that Saint James (called\nSantiago\nin Spanish) reportedly saw the apparition of Virgin Mary on the pillar, which is seen as the pivotal moment in the foundation of the Spanish Christian heritage.\nThe Aljafería Palace.\nAfter the fall of the empire, the city and the rest of today's Spain, was conquered by the\nGoths\nand then by the Moors. Zaragoza, was the northernmost stronghold of the Moorish caliphate, and then emerged as a capital of its own kingdom, or\nTaifa\n. The founding of the Taifa in the 11th century was marked by the construction of the Aljafeira Palace, which remains one of few relatively intact monuments from that era. Despite being often on the front line, Zaragoza continued to develop as a major art and science centre.\nBasilica del Pilar\nAs Zaragoza was regained by the Christian kings of Aragon, the development continued and the relative tolerance which Christians enjoyed under the Muslim rule was extended to the Moors initially. The Moorish artistic and architectural tradition was incorporated into the local architectural style called\nMudéjar\n, of which many examples survive in Zaragoza. Under Christian rule, Zaragoza's two cathedrals, the original\nLa seo\nand the\nBasilica del Pilar\n, were constructed to venerate the Virgin Mary apparition. The city's importance and affluence in the subsequent ages is reflected in its rich architectural heritage and many improvements given to its most important buildings, which gives them a number of layers of appeal.\nPlaza de España\nZaragoza has retained relative affluence by becoming a major industrial hub, with factories spread over several industrial parks around the city, and a big logistics hub (named\nPLAZA\n, or\nPlataforma Logística de Zaragoza\n), taking advantage of its strategic location on the railway line between Madrid and Barcelona and its airport, focusing on freight. The Expo 2008 universal exhibition held in the city resulted in massive development of its western outskirts into exhibition grounds, which have been repurposed for business, civic services and public recreation grounds.\nClimate\n[\nedit\n]\nZaragoza has a Continental Mediterranean climate, very dry, with cold winters and hot summers. With an average of 318 mm per year, rainfall is a rarity mostly occurring in spring. There is drought in summer with only a few storms in the late afternoon. In July and August temperatures are typically above 30°C (86°F), reaching up to 40°C (104°F) a few days per year. On those days you will quickly pick the idea of siesta: hiding away after lunch, during the hottest part of the day, to enjoy later the evenings and nights at a delightful 18-22°C.\nOffering of Fruits at El Pilar.\nIn winter the temperatures are low, usually between 0 and 10°C (32-50°F), with some frosts during the night. Snow only shows up once every couple of years but fog is not uncommon (about 20 days from November to January). However, the only bad part is the Cierzo, a cold and dry wind blowing from the NW that is quite common on clear days, and can make your stay really unpleasant. Beware also of sunny days in spring and autumn, if the Cierzo blows, you will regret not having warm clothes with you.\nWhen to visit\n[\nedit\n]\nEaster in Zaragoza.\nThe best time to visit Zaragoza is during spring (April to mid-June) and autumn (Sept-Oct). In late June and July the days can be quite hot but in the evenings the city is bustling with people going out for dinner or having a beer with friends in a terrace. In August the city is almost deserted, with most people being on holidays at the mountains or the coast, and more than half the bars, restaurants and small business closed.\nThe major city festival is El Pilar that takes place every year the week of the 12th of October, with lots of concerts, performances and street animations. It is also the best time to see a bullfight in Zaragoza.\nThe Easter week, although not in the same league that the Andalucia or Calanda counterparts, is very scenic, with several processions going over the city centre every day with their dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It is a Spain's\nFestival of International Tourist Interest\nsince 2014."

It has many museums and monuments that serve as portrayals of its rich history, but suffers under low cost mass tourism from the\nEuropean mainland\n. Its oldest mountain ranges are young compared to its neighbouring islands, and volcanic activity did not begin to occur here until 8-12 million years ago, while other islands had it well over 20 million years ago. The highest mountain of\nSpain\nand 3rd largest volcano in the world (3,715 m),\nEl Teide\n, dominates the landscape of the island.\nSanta Cruz de Tenerife\nis home to the Canary Island Parliament, while\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\nis home to the oldest university on the Canary Islands. The main resorts are\nPuerto de la Cruz\nand\nPlaya de las Américas\n.\n28.4\n-14\n2\nFuerteventura\n– Second largest island, with an area of 1,660 km², but compared to\nTenerife\nrelatively thinly populated with only 117,000 (2019) inhabitants. There are fewer attractions, but in turn the island has not yet fallen prey to mass tourism. Its capital,\nPuerto del Rosario\n, is fairly laid back and has a few architectural gems to offer. Fuerteventura is a paradise for windsurfing and the only Canary Island with natural golden sandy beaches rather than naturally black volcanic sand. The main resorts of Fuerteventura are Corralejo, Caleta de Fuste and Morro Jable.\n27.958611\n-15.5925\n3\nGran Canaria\n– The third largest island and second most popular (after\nTenerife\n) receiving over 4 million tourists every year–green and steep in the north, dry and flat in the south. It has the highest population density of the Canary Islands, with 540 inhabitants per km², and with tourists added to that number it gets a bit crowded at times. The main resorts on the Island are Las Palmas, Maspalomas, Puerto Rico and Playa del Ingles. Its capital city\nLas Palmas de Gran Canaria\nhas the shared title of capital of the Canaries.\n29.035\n-13.635\n4\nLanzarote\n– About half the size of\nGran Canaria\n, but low lying and arid, with a spectacular volcanic landscape in the west of the island preserved as\nTimanfaya National Park\n. The greatest recorded eruptions occurred between 1730–1736. The capital is\nArrecife\nand has its own airport, and draws most of the 2.9 million tourists visiting Lanzarote annually. There is a bustling nightlife in four main resorts—Arrecife, Costa Teguise, Puerto del Carmen and Playa Blanca.\n29.231389\n-13.501944\n5\nLa Graciosa\n– The smallest inhabited island of the Canaries, being only 29 km² in size and having a population of approx. 735 (2018). Its capital is Caleta de Sebo, and it's a few kilometres to the north of\nLanzarote\n.\n28.66\n-17.86\n6\nLa Palma\n– The population is about 83,000 (2019), of which about half live in the capital,\nSanta Cruz de la Palma\nand in\nLos Llanos de Aridane\n. La Palma's geographic layout is a result of the volcanic formation of the island. The southern part of La Palma is dominated by the Cumbre Vieja, a volcanic ridge formed by numerous volcanic cones built of lava and scoria. The Cumbre Vieja is active but mostly dormant, with the last eruption occurring in 2021.\n28.115\n-17.225\n7\nLa Gomera\n– The Magic Isle, with San Sebastián as capital, is a paradise for hikers. It is shaped like an orange that has been cut in half and split into segments. The terrain is rough, which has left deep ravines or barrancos between them. These barrancos, in turn, are covered by the laurisilva (laurel rain forest). The local wine has a distinct taste, and is often accompanied with a\ntapa\n(snack) of local cheese, roasted pork or goat meat. Other cultural dishes include\nalmogrote\n, a cheese spread, and a syrup extracted from palm trees called\nmiel de palma\n. The local people have a unique way of communicating across deep ravines by using a whistled speech called Silbo Gomero. This whistled language is indigenous to the island, and its existence has been documented since Roman times.\n27.75\n-18\n8\nEl Hierro\n– \"The edge of the world\". It is also known as the Meridian Island, and\nValverde\nis its capital.\nAll islands use the same time zone: Western European Time (\nWET\n).

Since the Canary Islands are a major European tourist destination, all the major islands have well-developed communication systems, airports, and ports.\nEthnically the population is mostly a mix of Spanish, European (German and British), South American, especially Cuban and Venezuelan as well as Northern and Sub-Sahara African. There are also historical minorities such as Indians, Koreans and lately Russians.\nEach island speaks with a slightly different accent and there is a strong rivalry between the main islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria. Most of the accents in the Canary Islands are closer to Latin American Spanish than to Castilian Spanish spoken in continental Spain.\nThe Canary Islands are very modern, very European, and extremely liberal.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nAncient legend claims the Canary Islands are the ‘lost islands’ of Atlantis. They have also been referred to as the lands without sorrow, holding on to the edge of the world. The first settlers were known as Guanches, thought to have arrived in the 10th century BC. The main economic system was built around agriculture and animal farming. During the 14th century, the islands were continuously invaded by different European countries. Sugar cane became the dominant crop, and since the early 20th century, bananas have been widely farmed.\nDuring the Age of Sail, the islands were an important waypoint on the\nCape Route\n.\nIn contrast to\nSpanish North Africa\nand other Spanish overseas territories, the Canary Islands have been an integrated part of Spain for centuries.\nClimate\n[\nedit\n]\nCanary Islands\nClimate chart (\nexplanation\n)\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\n32\n16\n10\n37\n16\n10\n29\n17\n11\n13\n18\n11\n4\n19\n12\n1\n20\n14\n0\n22\n16\n2\n23\n17\n6\n22\n16\n21\n21\n15\n33\n19\n13\n42\n17\n11\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °C\nPrecipitation\n+\nSnow\ntotals in mm\nGran Canaria Climate Averages\nImperial conversion\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\n1.3\n61\n50\n1.5\n61\n50\n1.1\n63\n52\n0.5\n64\n52\n0.2\n66\n54\n0\n68\n57\n0\n72\n61\n0.1\n73\n63\n0.2\n72\n61\n0.8\n70\n59\n1.3\n66\n55\n1.7\n63\n52\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °F\nPrecipitation\n+\nSnow\ntotals in inches\nOften referred to as\nthe islands of eternal spring\n, the Canary Islands are known for their mild climate. On average, they feature mild winters, although there is a lot of wind virtually every day, which makes temperatures feel cooler. Summers are dry and temperatures are generally comfortable but can feel chilly with the wind. The average temperature is 13°C in January and 19°C in July. Sunshine is somewhat abundant in summer and relatively scarce in winter.\nBeyond averages, though, the islands show remarkable variability in climate and weather. While the western part of the archipelago has a warm subtropical climate, the much flatter eastern islands of\nLanzarote\nand\nFuerteventura\nfeature a dryer desert climate. On the more mountainous islands, the terrain heavily influences the local climate.\nTenerife\n, for example, has a dry and sunny south that is perfect for a day at the beach. But as the high mountains catch the trade winds, the northern slopes receive more moisture. There, clouds tend to build up during the day, building the hikers' paradise that is the\nlaurisilva\ncloud forest.\nCalima\nis a common weather condition where a hazy and hot weather is caused by dust getting blown over from the Sahara desert. It will reduce visibility, cover everything with a layer of fine dust, heat up the islands, and may even cause some rain. It is more common in the winter, happens about once a month, and usually lasts for less than a week."

Here one can visit the caves of Ajuy, but the rocks are already very worth seeing. There is also the black sand beach. There is plenty of parking for cars. Also, a small restaurant is here with friendly service, simple Spanish food and drinks.

However, you can just lie in the still shallow waters and get a refreshment from the Atlantic.\nCofete\n[\nedit\n]\nA small village in the south (west coast of it), Jandia peninsula.

In the fortress, art pictures are exhibited. For a glimpse of El Cotillio this stop is enough. But the place has offers next to the fortress too. In the small Cotillo there are surprisingly many good restaurants (especially Canarian and Italian cuisine).\nThe place has a lot of peculiarities. From the fortress one has a beautiful view of the coasts to the north and south. The lagoon beach in the north towards lighthouses is suitable for families with small children. In the south the waves roll harder to the beach.\nHourly bus from Corralejo to El Cotillo is available. The direct bus connection with Puerto del Rosario is much rarer. It is best to visit the place with a rental car. No problem for parking.\nJandia\n[\nedit\n]\nA purely tourist artificial village, bordering Morro Jable. Jandia consists only of hotels, shops, bars and restaurants. The village has a small zoo.\nThe most important asset of Jandia is the beach. From Morro Jable, the beach with bright yellow sand stretches far east. There are beach sections that are guarded (with rent couches, bars and fast food), but also sections where you are very alone.\nIn the direction of Morro Jable the waves can hardly be felt. Going east, the waves become stronger. At the corner, where it goes northwards, a rock divides the beach; high waves can be enjoyed there.\nThe main street is also the shopping street. All are located in the north of the street, so you always have a view of the sea.\nOn Thursday, the African market takes place on the market square of Jandia.\nMorro Jable\n[\nedit\n]\nMorro Jable\nMorro Jable centre\nThe village begins with the harbour. There is a daily ferry service to Las Palmas; about 3½ hours. Morro Jable can not be reached directly from the port, a rock wall blocks the path.\nMorro Jable rises up the mountain. Here are the people who work in the Jandia hotels. From the port you have to go up the mountain, then down to the village centre. The town centre has not yet been taken over by tourists and there is something to do until late night.\nPájara\n[\nedit\n]\nAltar of the right nave of the Iglesia Nuestra Señora de Regla in Pájara, Fuerteventura\nPájara City hall\nThe capital of the southern province, but it's just a small village in the middle of the island.\nThe town is worth seeing to get a glimpse of the life of the locals. You can enjou some Spanish cuisine or coffee \"Leche y Leche\", which is an espresso on which one puts sweet condensed milk.\nThe church in the centre has a nice portal. Aztec art can be visited here. There is a lot of speculation as to how these works have emerged, the most plausible being a monk came home rich after the trip to South America and donated this portal."

In late June and July the days can be quite hot but in the evenings the city is bustling with people going out for dinner or having a beer with friends in a terrace. In August the city is almost deserted, with most people being on holidays at the mountains or the coast, and more than half the bars, restaurants and small business closed.\nThe major city festival is El Pilar that takes place every year the week of the 12th of October, with lots of concerts, performances and street animations. It is also the best time to see a bullfight in Zaragoza.\nThe Easter week, although not in the same league that the Andalucia or Calanda counterparts, is very scenic, with several processions going over the city centre every day with their dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It is a Spain's\nFestival of International Tourist Interest\nsince 2014."

There are also historical minorities such as Indians, Koreans and lately Russians.\nEach island speaks with a slightly different accent and there is a strong rivalry between the main islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria.

From the 18th century the Rioja region remained divided between the provinces of Burgos and Soria, until in 1833 the province of Logroño was created. The name of the province was changed to La Rioja in 1980 as a prelude to its constitution under a single provincial autonomous community in 1982. The name \"Rioja\" (from Río Oja) is first attested in 1099.\nThe region is well known for its wines, an integral part of Rioja's culture, listed under the brand\nDenominación de Origen Calizadas Rioja\n, the most highly regarded category in Spanish wine regulations."

On average, they feature mild winters, although there is a lot of wind virtually every day, which makes temperatures feel cooler. Summers are dry and temperatures are generally comfortable but can feel chilly with the wind. The average temperature is 13°C in January and 19°C in July. Sunshine is somewhat abundant in summer and relatively scarce in winter.\nBeyond averages, though, the islands show remarkable variability in climate and weather. While the western part of the archipelago has a warm subtropical climate, the much flatter eastern islands of\nLanzarote\nand\nFuerteventura\nfeature a dryer desert climate. On the more mountainous islands, the terrain heavily influences the local climate.\nTenerife\n, for example, has a dry and sunny south that is perfect for a day at the beach. But as the high mountains catch the trade winds, the northern slopes receive more moisture. There, clouds tend to build up during the day, building the hikers' paradise that is the\nlaurisilva\ncloud forest.\nCalima\nis a common weather condition where a hazy and hot weather is caused by dust getting blown over from the Sahara desert. It will reduce visibility, cover everything with a layer of fine dust, heat up the islands, and may even cause some rain. It is more common in the winter, happens about once a month, and usually lasts for less than a week."

The ALSA ticket counter can be found inside the terminal and a vending machine with ALSA tickets is close to the bus bays.\nFrom\nBarcelona Airport\n:\nThe easiest way is to take the half-hourly RENFE R2Nord suburban train to Barcelona Sants (20 min, €2.20), and then take the high speed train\nAVE\nto Zaragoza (1hr 45min, around €60). If you already have your AVE ticket, you can get the suburban train ticket for free in the automatic vending machines, by typing the code for “cercanías” that appears in your AVE ticket.\nIf you do not mind driving through vast empty natural spaces, other airports that are within reach of Zaragoza include Logroño and Reus.\nDelicias train station"

It gathered water from Rio Frio in the mountains 17 km south, flowing to the south edge of town to be stored and filtered. From there it turns and makes its spectacular leap across the valley, 28.5 m above Plazas Artilleria and del Azoguejo, to enter the Old Town. You can't walk on the structure, the best vantage point is at the head of the stairway into Old Town at Postigo del Consuelo. It's often floodlit at night.\nOld Town\nis easiest reached by walking from Plaza del Azoguejo up Calle Cervantes. Halfway up, Casa de los Picos (\"House of the Points\") is a 15th-century mansion with a facade studded with granite pyramids, and now an art college.\nCity walls\nmake a ring of 2250 m around the old town, erected in the 11th / 12th century and reinforced thereafter. They've been lost to the east approaching from the aqueduct but are substantial elsewhere.

It was wildly popular, as in medieval times it was the closest they got to romantic fiction. To this day, to \"build castles in Spain\" is the French equivalent of \"build castles in the air\", to engage in idle fantasy. It was mostly for the ease of a rhyme that the story picked Spain (where the rain falls mainly on the plain) but there were real knights and even more armchair warriors who dreamed of setting themselves up here, especially in the little kingdom named for its castles.\nMeseta Central\nis an extensive plateau at around 700-1000 m altitude, boxed in by mountain ranges that force the drainage west to the Atlantic, swelling into the river Duero / Douro. It's reasonably fertile, so it was mostly for agricultural produce that the Romans moved in from 218 BC, then they heard about the gold and other valuable metals. The gold mines of Médulas funded Rome the way the Americas later funded the Spanish Empire at its zenith. The aqueduct at Segovia is the Romans' best-known work here, and they built walls around several cities, maintained in later ages.\nThey marched away to be replaced by the Visigoths, but from around 710 AD the Moors captured all but the northern fringes of Spain. For over 200 years this region was a borderland, never beautified like the cities of Andalusia, and it became depopulated. The Christian pushback began in 722 and by 910 the Kingdom of León was established, covering the northwest quarter of Spain. Its eastern portion Castile split off in the 11th century but reunited in the 13th; this became a leading force in the\nReconquista\n, so places as far away as Seville and the Canaries became part of it, and the union with Aragon in 1469 effectively created a single Spain. The present autonomous community of\nCastilla y León\nis a smaller entity but still the largest subnational political unit in the European Union; it's larger than Belgium.\nLa Granja near Segovia\nThe\nReconquista\nwas not just territorial but cultural: the area was repopulated from further north, and churches and secular noble buildings sprang up everywhere. There was royal patronage as the court and capital moved about, until those settled in Madrid and Spain fell on hard times. Later industry and development was limited so this has left a wealth of old cities and sights such as cathedrals, many recognised as\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites\n.\nClimate\nreflects the altitude, with long cold winters averaging 3 - 6 °C in January, and short hot dry summers (19 - 22 °C). May-June and September are good times to visit and avoid the crowds.\nTalk:\nSpanish (in its standard Castilian form) is the working language. Staff in the hospitality sector may know other major European languages, but you should make an effort.\nVisitor info:\nPortal de Turismo\nis the regional online site, and there are physical tourist offices in the major cities."

In 722, a\nde facto\nindependent kingdom was established, which became the cradle of the incipient Reconquista (Reconquest).\nIn the 10th century, the Kingdom of Asturias gave way to the Kingdom of León. Through the rebellion of Prince Henry (the later Henry II of Castile) in the 14th century, the Principality of Asturias was established. Since 1388, the heir to the Castilian (later Spanish) throne has been styled \"Prince of Asturias\". Since June 2014, the title us held by Leonor, Princess of Asturias.\nIn the 18th century, Asturias was one of the centres of the Spanish Enlightenment. The Industrial Revolution came to Asturias after 1830 with the discovery and systematic exploitation of coal mines and iron factories at the mining basins of Nalón and Caudal. At the same time, there was significant migration to the Americas (especially Argentina, Uruguay, Puerto Rico, Cuba and Mexico); those who succeeded overseas often returned to their native land much wealthier. These entrepreneurs were known collectively as 'Indianos', for having visited and made their fortunes in the West Indies and beyond. The heritage of these wealthy families can still be seen in Asturias today: many large 'modernista' villas are dotted across the region, as well as cultural institutions such as free schools and public libraries.\nSince 1981, Asturias has been an autonomous community within Spain.\nClimate\n[\nedit\n]\nThe village of Cudillero\nThe region has a maritime climate. It receives plenty of annual rainfall and little sunshine by Spanish standards and has very moderated seasons, most often averaging in the lower 20s Celsius. Heat waves are rare due to mountains blocking southerly winds. Winters are very mild for the latitude, especially near sea level."

The Old City is a tangle of medieval-style streets roughly bounded by the Guadalquivir River on the south, the area surrounding Plaza de las Tendillas on the north and the tree-lined Paseo de la Victoria on the west.  This area is crammed with places to stay, eat and buy souvenirs, though many visitors may find certain areas (particularly immediately surrounding the Mezquita) too touristy, with more interesting things found wandering into the tiny streets of the Jewish Quarter to the west and north of the Mezquita. Behind the Mezquita the Roman Bridge crosses the Guadalquivir River to a museum in the old gate on the opposite side.\nThe area immediately to the north of the Old City, roughly from the area around Plaza de las Tendillas to Avenida de America is a more modern section of town and is where the train and bus station is located as well as a major shopping area. Along Paseo de la Victoria on the west side and Avenida de America on the north are large parks that make for a pleasant stroll.\nWith the rechargable green travel card you can use all means of public transport (regional trains, city and regional buses) for a lower price. The card can be bought in tobacco shops for €1.50 and must be charged with at least €5 (Nov 2024). There is another travel card issued by the city bus operator, but you can only use the city buses with that card."

    "text": "History\n[\nedit\n]\nWhen the Moors began their invasion of Spain in the 8th century, the mountainous territory of Asturias was difficult to conquer, and this region became a refuge for Christian nobles. In 722, a\nde facto\nindependent kingdom was established, which became the cradle of the incipient Reconquista (Reconquest).\nIn the 10th century, the Kingdom of Asturias gave way to the Kingdom of León. Through the rebellion of Prince Henry (the later Henry II of Castile) in the 14th century, the Principality of Asturias was established. Since 1388, the heir to the Castilian (later Spanish) throne has been styled \"Prince of Asturias\". Since June 2014, the title us held by Leonor, Princess of Asturias.\nIn the 18th century, Asturias was one of the centres of the Spanish Enlightenment. The Industrial Revolution came to Asturias after 1830 with the discovery and systematic exploitation of coal mines and iron factories at the mining basins of Nalón and Caudal. At the same time, there was significant migration to the Americas (especially Argentina, Uruguay, Puerto Rico, Cuba and Mexico); those who succeeded overseas often returned to their native land much wealthier. These entrepreneurs were known collectively as 'Indianos', for having visited and made their fortunes in the West Indies and beyond. The heritage of these wealthy families can still be seen in Asturias today: many large 'modernista' villas are dotted across the region, as well as cultural institutions such as free schools and public libraries.\nSince 1981, Asturias has been an autonomous community within Spain."

There are several well-established local rental companies that are well worth considering, already starting at €70/week or less, especially in off-season starting from April. On smaller islands like La Palma, the variety of companies is reduced though.\nBefore deciding to book, please verify the rental company's rating and their reviews on the common platforms, like\nTrustpilot\nor\nGoogle Maps\n! For some it is important to understand, what are their hidden catches and how they rip of customers. And some smaller local rental companies may be good, but you have never heard of them.\nLocal rental companies\n(always compare!):\nAutoReisen\n– Cheap, reliable and no deposit—from €9/day. Not very well known nor listed on the common price comparison websites. Pickup and drop-off is only possible at airports and on the same island. You must be at least 23 years old, and the rental price can only be paid by a credit or debit card in the driver's name. Ask around and you will see that people are very happy with them.\nPlusCar Rent a Car\n– Conditions are similar to AutoReisen—sometimes cheaper, sometimes more expensive. They also offer scooters, but unless you specifically want to go on two wheels, that's not cheaper. Likewise no deposit.\nCICAR\na.k.a.\nCabrera Medina\n– Reliable and well-known. A bit more expensive than AutoReisen and PlusCar, but with a wider range of models and a much denser network of rental branches all across the islands. No deposit for the car (but for the fuel).\nPaylessCar\n– Affordable and good.\nTopCar\n– From €12/day, but many people complain about consecutively being charged for missing fuel or cleaning in addition. Deposit: €500.\nCarzRent\n(Tenerife only) – Always open, large deposits and average prices.\nClickrent.es\n– Trigger offers from €2/day, but then a large insurance price on top of that. And while they claim on their website that they are highly rated (by the \"Feedback company\"), their rating on Trustpilot is below 4 (out of 5) — you are probably better off with on of the first ones in the upper list.\nInternational rental companies:\nGoldcar, Dollar, Interrent – Not worth the stress—they are well known for ripping off their customers. If you still decide to use them, make sure you understand their terms & conditions, since there may be hidden fees or other tricks.\nAvis, Europcar, Thrifty, Hertz, Enterprice – Probably not worth the extra money, unless you have a membership thing or get a good discount. However, most of the large companies such as Avis and Hertz have offices in the larger resort towns, but so does CiCar.\nThe\nrental conditions\nof the local companies typically include unlimited mileage, a free second driver and free booster seats for your kids. As a general rule, the driver must be at least 21 years old. Fuel is not included, so make sure to fuel up before returning your vehicle to avoid additional costs.\nNote\n, some companies initially offer very competitive prices on their websites, but in reality you are forced to buy a tank full of fuel and return the car empty (which is impossible). You are also expected to take additional insurance coverage unless you have already pre-arranged equivalent cover before your visit. (You should do this!). This makes the price almost double or triple from what was advertised.\nAs roads can often be narrow and unpaved, there is a real risk of damaging cars by ricocheting stones and pebbles. That's why most of the local companies include full insurance by default. When your rental car is fully insured, returning the vehicle is as simple as dropping off the key. Otherwise, inspect your rental car carefully before signing the contract, and consider adding insurance to the contract conditions for a surcharge.\nChoose your vehicle wisely - the local police knows that smaller is better.\nChoose a car\nthat is just large enough to fit all passengers and luggage, but try to keep it as small as possible. A small car is much easier to find a parking spot for in the historic centres of towns and cities, and passing another vehicle coming from the opposite direction becomes less of an adventure on narrow mountain roads. If you intend to do a lot of hiking, some extra ground clearance can occasionally come in handy, as paved parking lots can be a rare good in the mountains. Something like a Jeep Wrangler would be overkill for this, but if you've got money to burn, some of the local rental companies offer those too.\nBy taxi\n[\nedit\n]\nTaxis can be expensive, and inside a city they are not worth the money unless you are in a real hurry or cannot balance yourself after a shopping day.\nBy boat\n[\nedit\n]\nModern high speed ferries like the\nBajamar Express\nconnect the islands\nIf you want to travel between the islands, a good option might be to take a\nferry\n. Most ferries are modern, but they are pricey unless you have a residency status. Ferrygogo has a good\noverview of the different routes\nthat are served by the two main companies:\nNaviera Armas / Transmediterránea\n– Has many connections all across the region with a large mixed fleet of regular and high-speed ferries.\nFred Olsen\n– Focuses on high speed connections.\nThere are also a couple of scheduled\nwater bus\nand on-demand\nwater taxi\nconnections available for shorter trips:\nLineas Romero\n– Short distance passenger ferries connecting Lanzarote with Fuerteventura, and La Graciosa with Lanzarote.\nFuertecharter\n– Offers daily trips from Fuerteventura to Isla de Lobos and Lanzarote.\nCheck their website for the best prices. There is of course also a number of companies offering whale watching tours and the like.\nRenting a yacht (or bringing your own) is also a great way to get around if you know what you're doing. The islands offer numerous harbors and more than 30 marinas to moor in. Sailing the waters can be challenging, though, so plan your trip carefully. Some nautical information and useful links are available at the\nofficial website\n.\nBy plane\n[\nedit\n]\nIf you are afraid of the sea, or get sick just by staring at a ferry, then a plane is what you need to travel between the islands. With the exception of Graciosa (which only has a helipad for medical emergencies) all of the larger islands are served by regional airlines:\nBinter\nCanaryfly\nThat usually means a turboprop ATR-72 or ATR-42, especially when going to the regional airport of La Gomera or El Hierro that are too small for regular airliners to land on. They are perfectly safe and adequately fast, as you are likely to spend more time at the airport than in the plane. Especially between Tenerife and Gran Canaria there are also sometimes airlines that fly from further afield and stop in both islands—whether they sell tickets for that last leg alone is rather hit and miss, however."

In Asturias, it is protected under the Autonomous Status legislation, and it is an optional language at schools. There was a diglossia conflict between Asturian and Spanish, which resulted in some scholars considering it a dialect. However, nowadays, it is considered a separate language.\nMuch effort has been made since 1980 to protect and promote Asturian among the Asturian population. However, establishing the language as a co-official tongue is still awaited in most areas to protect this minority Romance language better. The situation of Asturian in other parts of Spain is critical, with a large decline in the number of speakers in the last 100 years. The area of Miranda de Douro in Portugal has taken a further step in protecting this language, by making it co-official.\nThough Asturian and Spanish are highly similar to one another, the prevalence of Asturian on road signs and maps means that travelers, for instance, may need to pay attention to name changes, such as how\nOviedo\nbecomes\nUviéu\nand\nGijón\nbecomes\nXixón\n.\nOne must also be aware while traveling through Asturias that almost\nnobody\nspeaks English. In other parts of Spain one can come across people who speak English to a limited extent (particularly in the larger cities), yet rarely will Asturians be able to understand you unless you make a considerable effort brush up on your Spanish. Bring a phrasebook and translate as you go if need be; the Asturian people are remarkably patient and welcoming and will be glad to invest time in helping you understand their culture, which they are intensely proud of."

The building is full of history and beauty - you'll want to give yourself at least a couple of hours to do it justice.\nBuilt in 786 as a mosque, the structure was expanded several times under Córdoba's Muslim rule while still remaining largely true to the original design.  Following the Christian Reconquista of Córdoba in 1236, work immediately went underway to convert the building to a church, and four centuries later a cathedral at the centre of the building was constructed, though not without controversy as it significantly altered the space. Today, despite the presence of the cathedral, most of the original mosque structure remains remarkably well-preserved.\nApproaching the Mezquita, the first thing you will notice is the massive\nbell tower\non the building's north side which looms over the surrounding buildings. Built in the 1600s the tower replaced a minaret previously on the site. Along the outside of the building the wall takes on the appearance of a fortress, with an elaborate set of Moorish-style archway and windows spaced every so often.\nStepping through one of the doors you'll enter the\nPatio de los Naranjos\n, or Court of the Orange Trees, which true to its name contains a grove of orange trees, planted in symmetrical rows that replicate the forest of columns within the building. A large fountain drips pleasantly in the middle, and the views of the bell tower framed by trees are excellent. The Patio is free to enter and is open during the day as a public park - the ticket booths are located on the bell tower side of the courtyard.\nEntering the\ninterior\nyou'll immediately be standing before the forest of columns which recede into the distance, topped with their dazzling horseshoe arches. The light in the space will play interesting tricks with the arches and varies pretty dramatically as you walk through the building, going from rather dark when you enter to very bright at the cathedral in the middle and back and forth as you continue.\nOpposite the room from the entrance is the\nMihrab\n, a spectacular archway decorated with Arabic writing which was the focus of the mosque, as it faced in the direction of Mecca and was what every Muslim faced as they knelt on the floor to pray. Once, tens of thousands of people could fit into this space to pray, the multitude knelt on their rugs before the Mihrab.  In the corner of the building nearby are glass cases with artifacts excavated from beneath the Mezquita, and the walls along the side of the building are lined with chapels, each one with an intricate piece of artwork.\nAt the centre of the building, the\nCathedral\ntowers over the rest of the building, and the transition from the impressive-but-intimate mosque structure to the overwhelming awe of the cathedral is abrupt and rather jarring, but don't let that stop you from taking in the beauty of the cathedral, with its rich decoration and well-illuminated interior, standing to suggest triumph over the Muslims who previously used this building.  The presence of the cathedral also offers the unique opportunity to so easily compare the differences between Muslim and Christian architecture.\nThe Old City\n[\nedit\n]\nViews of the Historic centre of Córdoba from the Guadalquivir River.\nA tangle of narrow medieval streets surrounding the Mezquita, the Old City sits just uphill from the muddy Guadalquivir River and contains the vast majority of Córdoba's tourist attractions. North and west of the Mezquita sits the\nJewish Quarter\n, a neighborhood which dates from the late Middle Ages and offers an interesting stroll, some lovely patios and a few scant reminders of the Jewish population that once lived here.\n37.876667\n-4.778056\n1\nRoman Bridge\n(\nPuente Romano\n).\nA Roman-style bridge over the shallow Guadalquivir River that was once the main crossing over the river, securing Córdoba's importance to the region. The entrance to the bridge is marked by a triumphal arch and an adjacent single-column monument and it crosses to an old fortified gate (now a museum, described below) on the other side.\n37.8757\n-4.7767\n2\nMuseum of Al-Andalus Life\n(\nMuseo Vivo de Al-Andalus\n),\nC/ Puente Romano\n(\nat the opposite end of the Roman Bridge\n),\n☏\n+34 957 293 929\n.\nOctober-April 10:00-18:00, May-September, 10:00-14:00 and 16:30-20:30\n.\nA history museum located in the Torre de la Calahorra, which once served as the old fortified gate to the city. Upon entering the museum the greeters (who speak good English) have you don a headset which will explain the exhibits and artifacts on Muslim Andalusia you will view as you walk from room to room. The narrators take a very philosophical take on the whole thing and their descriptions of Islam may come off as rather flowery, but the artifacts are worth a look and the balcony on the top of the tower offers an excellent view of the river and the city.\n€4.50, €3 children\n.\n37.877222\n-4.781944\n3\nAlcazar de los Reyes Cristianos\n,\nC/ Caballerizas Reales\n.\nTu-F 08:30-19:30, Sa 09:30-16:30, Su 09:30-14:30\n.\nBuilt in the 8th century as a caliphate residence on the site of a Visigoth fortress, the Alcazar was used as the residence and fortress of Ferdinand and Isabella (the \"Christian Monarchs\" for whom the building is now named) as well as a headquarters for the Spanish Inquisition.

    "text": "By rental car\n[\nedit\n]\nRenting a car is often the best option for discovering the remote and wildness regions —\nTenerife\nmight be an exception with its very efficient bus system. There are several well-established local rental companies that are well worth considering, already starting at €70/week or less, especially in off-season starting from April. On smaller islands like La Palma, the variety of companies is reduced though.\nBefore deciding to book, please verify the rental company's rating and their reviews on the common platforms, like\nTrustpilot\nor\nGoogle Maps\n! For some it is important to understand, what are their hidden catches and how they rip of customers. And some smaller local rental companies may be good, but you have never heard of them.\nLocal rental companies\n(always compare!):\nAutoReisen\n– Cheap, reliable and no deposit—from €9/day. Not very well known nor listed on the common price comparison websites. Pickup and drop-off is only possible at airports and on the same island. You must be at least 23 years old, and the rental price can only be paid by a credit or debit card in the driver's name. Ask around and you will see that people are very happy with them.\nPlusCar Rent a Car\n– Conditions are similar to AutoReisen—sometimes cheaper, sometimes more expensive. They also offer scooters, but unless you specifically want to go on two wheels, that's not cheaper. Likewise no deposit.\nCICAR\na.k.a.\nCabrera Medina\n– Reliable and well-known. A bit more expensive than AutoReisen and PlusCar, but with a wider range of models and a much denser network of rental branches all across the islands. No deposit for the car (but for the fuel).\nPaylessCar\n– Affordable and good.\nTopCar\n– From €12/day, but many people complain about consecutively being charged for missing fuel or cleaning in addition. Deposit: €500.\nCarzRent\n(Tenerife only) – Always open, large deposits and average prices.\nClickrent.es\n– Trigger offers from €2/day, but then a large insurance price on top of that. And while they claim on their website that they are highly rated (by the \"Feedback company\"), their rating on Trustpilot is below 4 (out of 5) — you are probably better off with on of the first ones in the upper list.\nInternational rental companies:\nGoldcar, Dollar, Interrent – Not worth the stress—they are well known for ripping off their customers. If you still decide to use them, make sure you understand their terms & conditions, since there may be hidden fees or other tricks.\nAvis, Europcar, Thrifty, Hertz, Enterprice – Probably not worth the extra money, unless you have a membership thing or get a good discount. However, most of the large companies such as Avis and Hertz have offices in the larger resort towns, but so does CiCar.\nThe\nrental conditions\nof the local companies typically include unlimited mileage, a free second driver and free booster seats for your kids. As a general rule, the driver must be at least 21 years old. Fuel is not included, so make sure to fuel up before returning your vehicle to avoid additional costs.\nNote\n, some companies initially offer very competitive prices on their websites, but in reality you are forced to buy a tank full of fuel and return the car empty (which is impossible). You are also expected to take additional insurance coverage unless you have already pre-arranged equivalent cover before your visit. (You should do this!). This makes the price almost double or triple from what was advertised.\nAs roads can often be narrow and unpaved, there is a real risk of damaging cars by ricocheting stones and pebbles. That's why most of the local companies include full insurance by default. When your rental car is fully insured, returning the vehicle is as simple as dropping off the key. Otherwise, inspect your rental car carefully before signing the contract, and consider adding insurance to the contract conditions for a surcharge.\nChoose your vehicle wisely - the local police knows that smaller is better.\nChoose a car\nthat is just large enough to fit all passengers and luggage, but try to keep it as small as possible. A small car is much easier to find a parking spot for in the historic centres of towns and cities, and passing another vehicle coming from the opposite direction becomes less of an adventure on narrow mountain roads. If you intend to do a lot of hiking, some extra ground clearance can occasionally come in handy, as paved parking lots can be a rare good in the mountains. Something like a Jeep Wrangler would be overkill for this, but if you've got money to burn, some of the local rental companies offer those too."

The land had been the orchard of the convent of San Francisco, and was converted into a plaza in 1838. It was then redeveloped again in 1897, and has remained virtually unchanged since that time. The houses which face the plaza, many of which can be classified as neo-classical architecture or built in the style of Isabelline Gothic, were built for the Cádiz\nbourgeoisie\n.\nThe Plaza de la Catedral houses the Cathedral and the Baroque church of\nSantiago\n, built in 1635.\nPlaza de San Francisco and San Francisco Church and Convent\n[\nedit\n]\nSan Francisco church\nLocated next to Plaza de Mina, this smaller square houses the San Francisco church and convent. It was built in 1566, and was substantially renovated in the 17th century, when its cloisters were added. The Plaza de Mina used to be the convent's orchard.\nPlaza San Antonio\n[\nedit\n]\nPlaza de San Antonio and church\nIn the 19th century, Plaza San Antonio was considered to be Cádiz's main square. The square is surrounded by a number of mansions built in neo-classical architecture or Isabelline Gothic style, once occupied by the Cádiz upper classes. San Antonio church, built in 1669, is also in the plaza.\nThe plaza was built in the 18th century, and the Spanish Constitution of 1812 was proclaimed here.\nPlaza de Candelaria\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Plaza de Candelaria is named after the Candelaria convent, situated in the square until it was demolished in 1873 under the First Spanish Republic, when its grounds were redeveloped as a plaza. The plaza is notable for a statue in its centre of Emilio Castelar, president of the first Spanish republic, who was born in a house facing the square. A plaque situated on another house, states that Bernardo O'Higgins, an Irish-Chilean adventurer and dictator of Chile, also lived in the square.\nPlaza de la Catedral and the Cathedral\n[\nedit\n]\nCádiz Cathedral\nOne of Cádiz's most famous landmarks is its cathedral. Work on this cathedral started in 1722 and was supervised by the architect Vicente Acero, who had also built the Granada Cathedral. Acero resigned from the project and was succeeded by several other architects. As a result, this largely Baroque-style cathedral was built over a period of 116 years, and, due to this drawn-out period of construction, the cathedral underwent several major changes to its original design. Though the cathedral was intended to be a baroque edifice with some rococo elements, it was completed in the Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style. Climb to the top of the North Tower for a nice view of the entire city.\nPlaza de San Juan de Dios and the Old Town Hall\n[\nedit\n]\nView of the Plaza de San Juan de Dios, featuring the façade of the Old Town Hall.\nConstruction of this plaza began in the 15th century on lands reclaimed from the sea. With the demolition of the city walls in 1906 the plaza increased in size and a statue of the Cádiz politician Segismundo Moret was unveiled. Overlooking the plaza, the\nAyuntamiento\nis the town hall of Cádiz's\nOld City\n.\nPlaza de España and the monument to the Constitution of 1812\n[\nedit\n]\nMonument to the Constitution of 1812\nThe Plaza de España is a large square close to the port. It is dominated by the\nMonument to the Constitution of 1812\n, which came into being as a consequence of the demolition of a portion of the old city wall.\nPlaza de Falla and the Gran Teatro Falla (Falla Grand Theater)\n[\nedit\n]\nThe theater was built between 1884 and 1905 over the remains of the previous Gran Teatro. The outside was covered in red bricks and is of a neo-Mudéjar or Moorish Revival style.\nThe Constitution of 1812 Bridge, also known as La Pepa Bridge, is a new bridge across the Bay of Cádiz, linking Cádiz with the town of Puerto Real.\nThis is one of the highest bridges in Europe, with 5 km in total length. It is the third access to the city, along with the San Fernando road and the Carranza bridge.\nTavira tower\n[\nedit\n]\nThis tower was located on a high point in the city, near the Central Market (Mercado de Abastos), 45 m above sea level. It was chosen by the Navy as their official lookout in 1787. It is the tallest of the towers which still dot the Cádiz skyline. There is a\ncamera obscura\n, a room that uses the principle of the pinhole camera and a specially prepared convex lens to project panoramic views of the Old City onto a concave disc.  One of the towers that was used by merchants to watch out for their ships returning home from the Americas, it provides a birds-eye view of the old part of town.\nAdmiral's House\n[\nedit\n]\nAdmiral's House\nThe\nCasa del Almirante\nis a palatial house, adjacent to the Plaza San Martín in the Barrio del Pópulo, which was constructed in 1690 with the proceeds of the lucrative trade with the Americas.  The exterior is sheathed in exquisite red and white Genoan marble. The colonnaded portico, the grand staircase under the cupola, and the hall on the main floor are architectural features of great nobility and beauty.\nOld customs house\n[\nedit\n]\nPlaza de las Tortugas\nSituated within the confines of the walls which protect the flank of the port of Cádiz are three identical adjacent buildings: the Customs House, the House of Hiring and the Consulate. Of the three, the former had been erected first, built in a sober neo-classical style and of ample and balanced proportions. The works began in 1765.\nPalacio de Congresos\n[\nedit\n]\nCádiz's refurbished tobacco factory offers international conference and trade-show facilities.\nRoman theatre\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Roman theatre was discovered in 1980, in the El Pópulo district, after a fire had destroyed some old warehouses, revealing a layer of construction that was judged to be the foundations of some medieval buildings; the foundations of these buildings had been built, in turn, upon much more ancient stones, hand-hewn limestone of a Roman character. Systematic excavations have revealed a largely intact Roman theatre.\nThe theatre, constructed during the 1st century BC, is the second-largest Roman theatre in the world, surpassed only by the theatre of Pompeii.\nPylons of Cádiz\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Pylons of Cádiz are electricity pylons of unusual design, one on either side of the Bay of Cádiz, used to support huge electric-power cables. The pylons are 158 m high.\nCity walls and fortifications\n[\nedit\n]\nLas Puertas de Tierra\noriginated in the 16th century. Once consisting of several layers of walls, only one of these remain today. By the 20th century it was necessary to remodel the entrance to the Old City to accommodate modern traffic. Today, the two side-by-side arches cut into the wall serve as one of the primary entrances to the city.\nEl Arco de los Blancos\nis the gate to the Populo district, built around 1300. It was the principal gate to the medieval town. The gate is named after the family of Felipe Blanco who built a chapel (now disappeared) above the gate.\nEl Arco de la Rosa\n(\"Rose Arch\") is a gate carved into the medieval walls next to the cathedral. It is named after captain Gaspar de la Rosa, who lived in the city during the 18th century. The gate was renovated in 1973.\nThe\nBaluarte de la Candelaria\n(fortress or stronghold of Candlemas) is a military fortification. Taking advantage of a natural elevation of land, it was constructed in 1672. Protected by a seaward-facing wall that had previously served as a seawall, Candelaria's cannons were in a position to command the channels approaching the port of Cádiz. It is now used as a cultural venue.\nThe\nCastle of San Sebastián\nis also a military fortification and is situated at the end of a road leading out from the Caleta beach. It was built in 1706.\nThe\nCastle of Santa Catalina\nis also a military fortification at the end of the Caleta beach. It was built in 1598 following the English sacking of Cádiz two years earlier. It is used for exhibitions and concerts."

The building is full of history and beauty - you'll want to give yourself at least a couple of hours to do it justice.\nBuilt in 786 as a mosque, the structure was expanded several times under Córdoba's Muslim rule while still remaining largely true to the original design.  Following the Christian Reconquista of Córdoba in 1236, work immediately went underway to convert the building to a church, and four centuries later a cathedral at the centre of the building was constructed, though not without controversy as it significantly altered the space. Today, despite the presence of the cathedral, most of the original mosque structure remains remarkably well-preserved.\nApproaching the Mezquita, the first thing you will notice is the massive\nbell tower\non the building's north side which looms over the surrounding buildings. Built in the 1600s the tower replaced a minaret previously on the site. Along the outside of the building the wall takes on the appearance of a fortress, with an elaborate set of Moorish-style archway and windows spaced every so often.\nStepping through one of the doors you'll enter the\nPatio de los Naranjos\n, or Court of the Orange Trees, which true to its name contains a grove of orange trees, planted in symmetrical rows that replicate the forest of columns within the building. A large fountain drips pleasantly in the middle, and the views of the bell tower framed by trees are excellent. The Patio is free to enter and is open during the day as a public park - the ticket booths are located on the bell tower side of the courtyard.\nEntering the\ninterior\nyou'll immediately be standing before the forest of columns which recede into the distance, topped with their dazzling horseshoe arches. The light in the space will play interesting tricks with the arches and varies pretty dramatically as you walk through the building, going from rather dark when you enter to very bright at the cathedral in the middle and back and forth as you continue.\nOpposite the room from the entrance is the\nMihrab\n, a spectacular archway decorated with Arabic writing which was the focus of the mosque, as it faced in the direction of Mecca and was what every Muslim faced as they knelt on the floor to pray. Once, tens of thousands of people could fit into this space to pray, the multitude knelt on their rugs before the Mihrab.  In the corner of the building nearby are glass cases with artifacts excavated from beneath the Mezquita, and the walls along the side of the building are lined with chapels, each one with an intricate piece of artwork.\nAt the centre of the building, the\nCathedral\ntowers over the rest of the building, and the transition from the impressive-but-intimate mosque structure to the overwhelming awe of the cathedral is abrupt and rather jarring, but don't let that stop you from taking in the beauty of the cathedral, with its rich decoration and well-illuminated interior, standing to suggest triumph over the Muslims who previously used this building.  The presence of the cathedral also offers the unique opportunity to so easily compare the differences between Muslim and Christian architecture."

    "text": "Plazas and their landmark buildings\n[\nedit\n]\nThe old town of Cádiz is one of the most densely populated urban areas in Europe, and is packed with narrow streets. The old town benefits, though, from several striking plazas, which are enjoyed by citizens and tourists alike. These are the\nPlaza de Mina\n,\nPlaza San Antonio\n,\nPlaza de Candelaria\n,\nPlaza de San Juan de Dios\n, and\nPlaza de España\n.\nPlaza de Mina\n[\nedit\n]\nLocated in the heart of the old town, Plaza de Mina was developed in the first half of the 19th century. The land had been the orchard of the convent of San Francisco, and was converted into a plaza in 1838. It was then redeveloped again in 1897, and has remained virtually unchanged since that time. The houses which face the plaza, many of which can be classified as neo-classical architecture or built in the style of Isabelline Gothic, were built for the Cádiz\nbourgeoisie\n.\nThe Plaza de la Catedral houses the Cathedral and the Baroque church of\nSantiago\n, built in 1635.\nPlaza de San Francisco and San Francisco Church and Convent\n[\nedit\n]\nSan Francisco church\nLocated next to Plaza de Mina, this smaller square houses the San Francisco church and convent. It was built in 1566, and was substantially renovated in the 17th century, when its cloisters were added. The Plaza de Mina used to be the convent's orchard.\nPlaza San Antonio\n[\nedit\n]\nPlaza de San Antonio and church\nIn the 19th century, Plaza San Antonio was considered to be Cádiz's main square. The square is surrounded by a number of mansions built in neo-classical architecture or Isabelline Gothic style, once occupied by the Cádiz upper classes. San Antonio church, built in 1669, is also in the plaza.\nThe plaza was built in the 18th century, and the Spanish Constitution of 1812 was proclaimed here.\nPlaza de Candelaria\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Plaza de Candelaria is named after the Candelaria convent, situated in the square until it was demolished in 1873 under the First Spanish Republic, when its grounds were redeveloped as a plaza. The plaza is notable for a statue in its centre of Emilio Castelar, president of the first Spanish republic, who was born in a house facing the square. A plaque situated on another house, states that Bernardo O'Higgins, an Irish-Chilean adventurer and dictator of Chile, also lived in the square.\nPlaza de la Catedral and the Cathedral\n[\nedit\n]\nCádiz Cathedral\nOne of Cádiz's most famous landmarks is its cathedral. Work on this cathedral started in 1722 and was supervised by the architect Vicente Acero, who had also built the Granada Cathedral. Acero resigned from the project and was succeeded by several other architects. As a result, this largely Baroque-style cathedral was built over a period of 116 years, and, due to this drawn-out period of construction, the cathedral underwent several major changes to its original design. Though the cathedral was intended to be a baroque edifice with some rococo elements, it was completed in the Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style. Climb to the top of the North Tower for a nice view of the entire city.\nPlaza de San Juan de Dios and the Old Town Hall\n[\nedit\n]\nView of the Plaza de San Juan de Dios, featuring the façade of the Old Town Hall.\nConstruction of this plaza began in the 15th century on lands reclaimed from the sea. With the demolition of the city walls in 1906 the plaza increased in size and a statue of the Cádiz politician Segismundo Moret was unveiled. Overlooking the plaza, the\nAyuntamiento\nis the town hall of Cádiz's\nOld City\n.\nPlaza de España and the monument to the Constitution of 1812\n[\nedit\n]\nMonument to the Constitution of 1812\nThe Plaza de España is a large square close to the port. It is dominated by the\nMonument to the Constitution of 1812\n, which came into being as a consequence of the demolition of a portion of the old city wall.\nPlaza de Falla and the Gran Teatro Falla (Falla Grand Theater)\n[\nedit\n]\nThe theater was built between 1884 and 1905 over the remains of the previous Gran Teatro. The outside was covered in red bricks and is of a neo-Mudéjar or Moorish Revival style.\nThe Constitution of 1812 Bridge, also known as La Pepa Bridge, is a new bridge across the Bay of Cádiz, linking Cádiz with the town of Puerto Real.\nThis is one of the highest bridges in Europe, with 5 km in total length. It is the third access to the city, along with the San Fernando road and the Carranza bridge."

In winter, day temperature is normally 23° and by night 16-17°. Bad weather can occur, especially between mid-October and March. Temperatures can then drop to 11-12° and be quite windy.\nArguineguín has the best climate, with the least wind, and is, due to its protected location, among the driest in winter too.\nLas Palmas has a bit of a different climate, and is sometimes clouded and rain might occur, even in May or June, but it is not very common. If you travel in winter take at least a thick jacket or two. If you plan to travel to the mountains bring or buy a scarf and gloves. The freezing point can be reached on Pozo de Las Nieves.\nIn summertime, always bring a bottle of water during the day. If winds from Sahara occur and temperatures rise above 40 °C, try to stay in the shadows, close to climatized air and always drink plenty of water."

The more well known is Cabrales cheese.\nCabrales cheese is produced only in the village of the same name and three villages of the Peñamellera Alta township, located on the northern spur of the Europa Peaks in eastern Asturias.\nThis is certainly the most well-known Spanish blue cheese due to the manner in which goat farmers jealously guard its origin and authenticity; and one of the great blue cheeses of the world. Also its highly recommended cheese Gamoneu, which is considered to be one of the best cheeses in Europe, its a special kind of blue cheese, similar to Cabrales, but smoother and more solid, quite expensive and hard to find.\nFrixuelos: These are very similar to the French crêpes (actually have the same Celtic/atlantic arc-cuisine origin), and are eaten as a dessert.\nCachopo: Its a delicious breaded, fried kid of \"sandwich\" of ham and cheese, cachopo is a little similar to Cordon Bleu but a lot bigger. Make sure to eat it in a good place, as many places will use cheaper ingredients and you won't be getting the real thing.\nArroz con Leche: Its a rice pudding dessert, also very popular made just in Asturias, every place has its very own recipe.\nIn general it's recommended to eat in small villages or places far from the city center, the quality of the food will always better and of course more affordable prices.

The ticket machines are not the easiest to navigate as they use only contactless\n+renfe & tu\ntickets. If you don't have one, the reusable ticket is provided with your first purchase.\nFortunately there is now an easier option for single journeys. You can use a contactless bank card (Visa/Mastercard) on certain barriers on commencing your journey and again when you finish the journey to exit the station. The correct fare is charged to your card if you use it at both ends of the journey.

In the inner cities, as night life is huge, and even grandmothers pushing strollers can be seen at midnight, being out late isn't a big concern (I felt safe walking 30 minutes home alone at night, and I'm female, although it is always preferable to walk with others at night as an added precaution). Of course it depends on the area and bags can be snatched every now and then, so use common sense.\nAsturias is considered one of the safest places in Europe, and its capital (Oviedo) has been awarded as the safest city in Europe. Children or women can walk alone all the night long without their parents caring.\nAny hikers attempting to traverse parts of Asturias on foot should also be wary of the region's notorious weather. Asturias is unlike the majority of Spain, in that consecutive days of non-stop rain and drizzle accompanied by summer temperatures barely reaching 20°C are not uncommon. However, the biggest problem any outdoor types will face is how fast the weather can change. One can be walking in clear blue skies and warm weather and suddenly find themselves stranded in exceedingly dense fog (and vice versa, meaning one must always carry a suitable amount of water and protection from the sun)."

The present-day version of the church superseded it and was constructed on the orders of King Charles II of Spain between 1681 and 1872. The protracted construction has been caused by frequent redesigns, including a reorientation, additions of towers and cupolas.

Many other reconstructions followed, due to both changing tastes and architectural necessities, as parts of the cheaply-built cathedral began to fail over time, including the collapse of the its in the 15th century.\nIn the 17th century, the church has been involved in a canon law battle with the newly-reconstructed Basilica of Our Lady on the Pillar over which should be the seat of the diocese and thus the cathedral, which finally saw Pope Clement X declare them joint cathedrals with special provisions to make sure both enjoy equal status.\nLa Seo\nis now a mixture of styles spanning between 12th and 19th centuries, and features an exquisite collection of tapestries.

The Island is split into five\nAjuntaments\n, as noted in\nCities\nabove. Their role is much the same as a council: providing local government, services, and maintenance for both citizens and tourists.\nSant Joan de Labritja\noccupies the north, with\nSanta Eulària des Riu\nin the east,\nSant Josep de sa Talaia\nin the south, and\nSant Antoni de Portmany\nin the west.\nEivissa Vila (Ibiza Town)\ntucks in-between\nSanta Eulària\nand\nSant Josep\n- but its small size shouldn't detract from its position as the third-highest populated municipality in all of the Balearics.\nOutside of the towns, the municipalities are strikingly rural: their untouched simplicity and majesty being a strong contributor to the Island's position as a\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\nfor its biodiversity and culture. Their beauty is due to their preservation: many areas, such as the\nSes Salines\nNature Park, have strong restrictions on which areas can be walked on, whilst some beaches (even those within resorts) might have designated roped-off areas to access the beaches in order to maintain and preserve both the sand dunes themselves and the biodiversity within them.\nThe Island is largely flat, with rocky inlets occasionally rising above sea level. The sand and calcium-rich volcanic soil lend themselves to wildlife, resulting in thousands of pine trees and almond blossom lining the Island. The highest point on the Island is\nSa Talaiassa\nwhich stands at 476 metres.\nName\n[\nedit\n]\nGiven the multitude of languages spoken on the Island, the name for\nIbiza\nhas evolved gradually - the designation\nIbiza\nonly becoming a concrete moniker after the late-20th century package holiday boom.\nIbiza\nis the Spanish name for the Island, which has led to its widespread use in English cultures. As detailed in\nTalk\n, however, the Island's official language is Balearic Catalan. In Catalan, the island's title is\nEivissa\n- though this is now more often is used in reference to the island's capital city.\nHistorically, the Island's name was\nIbossim\n, a Phoenician name that evolved into the Roman\nEbusus\n. From this title, the modern name emerged - with the title\nIvica\nbeing applied by the British army in the 18thcentury.\nIbiza and\nFormentera\nare also known collectively as the\nIslas Pitiusas\n(from the Greek word \"pitys\" meaning pine tree) because of the abundance of pines that cover their landscapes. This phrase is an evolution of the original\nPityoûssai\n, which literally meant 'Pine-covered Islands'.\nThere are about 111,200 inhabitants.\nIt is world-famous for its intense nightlife and huge clubs, and attracts top DJs from all over the planet. It is the most popular\nSpring break\ndestination for European college students."

Outbreaks are rare, though, and any seismic activities are closely monitored to provide early warnings to the population. Moderate\nearthquakes\ncan occur, but they typically do not exceed magnitudes of 5.5. Tropical\nstorms\nsometimes reach the archipelago and can cause flooding and destruction in the coastal areas. All of the above mean that the terrain can be steep and unstable, making\nfalling rocks and landslides\na very real danger. If a mountain road or hiking trail is closed, that is usually because of this.\nEpisodes of heavy\nCalima\n(see\nClimate\n) may lead to respiratory problems, coughing, nasal obstruction and itchy eyes. Consider wearing a N95 type respirator outside, hydrate enough, and stay indoors if it gets too dusty.\nHeat strokes and sunburn\nare an underestimated risk, as solar radiation so close to the equator is much stronger than many European tourists expect. The latter is maybe even more of a concern in the high mountains, where the air is thinner and feels more breezy.\nThere are no poisonous or otherwise dangerous wild animals around, and while mosquitoes may bite you on occasion, they do not carry\ninfectious diseases\n."

Holding an additional rank of basilica, this cathedral venerates the Virgin Mary who reportedly appeared to Saint James the Apostle on said riverbank during his travels in Iberia. Mary appeared on a pillar, which led to her being venerated under this particular name and also gave origin to the unusual Spanish female given name\nPilar\n.\nSaint James is believed to have had a small shrine constructed by the pillar, of which nothing remains, but subsequently a large basilica was built on the site in the 3rd century under the rule of the Roman Emperor Constantine. This basilica has been rebuilt over the years, and became a Gothic church in the 15th century. The present-day version of the church superseded it and was constructed on the orders of King Charles II of Spain between 1681 and 1872. The protracted construction has been caused by frequent redesigns, including a reorientation, additions of towers and cupolas. It also allowed for the domes to be painted by Francisco Goya a century after the construction started, and the vault paintings are now one of the main attractions on the inside of the cathedral.\nThe baroque tower, neoclassical facade and\nmudejar\ndome of\nla seo\n41.65468\n-0.87565\n2\nCathedral of the Savior of Zaragoza\n(\nLa Seo de Zaragoza\n).\nsummer: 10:00-21:00, winter: 10:00-18:30\n.\nLocated on the Plaza de la Seo, the cathedral is referred to as\nla seo\n(\"the see\") to distinguish it from the other cathedral,\nel pilar\n.\nLa Seo\nhas originally been constructed one the site one of the first mosques during the Moorish domination of Aragon, built perhaps as early as the 8th century, and destroyed to make way for a romanesque church in the 12th century. Zaragoza became an independent diocese in the 14th century and the church became its cathedral, immediately being afforded renovations in the gothic and moorish (\nmudéjar\n) styles. Many other reconstructions followed, due to both changing tastes and architectural necessities, as parts of the cheaply-built cathedral began to fail over time, including the collapse of the its in the 15th century.\nIn the 17th century, the church has been involved in a canon law battle with the newly-reconstructed Basilica of Our Lady on the Pillar over which should be the seat of the diocese and thus the cathedral, which finally saw Pope Clement X declare them joint cathedrals with special provisions to make sure both enjoy equal status.\nLa Seo\nis now a mixture of styles spanning between 12th and 19th centuries, and features an exquisite collection of tapestries. Entrance closes sometimes during the day when there's mass.\n€4\n.\nIglesias Mudejares\n(\nMoorish churches\n).\nMudejar is a style that mixes Christian and Muslim tradition.

As the monopoly was broken and\nCádiz\nlargely took Seville's place, the city entered a period of relative decline.\nIn the 19th century Seville gained a reputation for its architecture and culture and was a stop along the Romantic \"\nGrand Tour\n\" of Europe. Seville has built on its tourism industry since, playing host to the International Exposition in 1992, which spurred the construction of a new airport, a new train station, a bullet train link to Madrid, new bridges and improvements to the main boulevards.\nFor\nclassical music\nbuffs, Seville is the setting of many famous operas over the years, such as Mozart's\nLe nozze di Figaro\nand\nDon Giovanni\n, Beethoven's\nFidelio\n, Rossini's\nIl barbiere di Siviglia\nand  Bizet's\nCarmen\n.\nVisitor information\n[\nedit\n]\nTurismo de la Provincia de Sevilla\n.\n(\nupdated Jul 2021\n)"

In October 2019, the Spanish government exhumed the remains of Franco and Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera and transferred them to the Franco family crypt in Madrid. This might decrease the attraction of this site for fascists making pilgrimage to it. There's a public bus from El Escorial, but from its dropoff point it's a 6-km hike.

Consider wearing a N95 type respirator outside, hydrate enough, and stay indoors if it gets too dusty.\nHeat strokes and sunburn\nare an underestimated risk, as solar radiation so close to the equator is much stronger than many European tourists expect.

Iberia, Vueling and other carriers fly from Madrid, Mallorca, Asturias, Bilbao, Barcelona, Valencia, Tenerife, Lanzarote, Melilla in Spanish North Africa, and other European cities. It's only worth flying here from Madrid if you have a connecting flight, as the trains from the capital are so fast.\n37.423\n-5.9\n1\nSevilla Airport\n(\nSVQ\nIATA\n) (\n10 km northeast of city centre on A-4\n).\nThe airport is a single terminal with Arrivals downstairs, with car hire desks and not much else. There are more groundside cafes and other facilities upstairs in the Departures hall. From there you pass through security and U-turn into the long airside mall. Gates are divided into areas A and B for Schengen destinations and C for non-Schengen destinations. Cafes and shops line the first half of the mall in areas A and B. Passport control for non-Schengen destinations is between B and C, but don't pass through to area C until an hour before your flight (or when displayed on flight information screens) as there are only toilets and one cafe in this area.   NOTE:  As at January 2024 there are only two manual passport control booths operating for all non-Schengen departures and these only open 45 minutes before flight departure time.  The e-gates are non operational. If there are two flights leaving around the same time from the C Gates, be prepared for queues.\n(\nupdated Apr 2023\n)\nGetting there/away:\nTussam Bus EA\n[dead link]\n(for \"Especial Aeropuerto\") runs daily every 15 min from 05:00 to 00:30. One-way ticket €5, same-day round trip €6 (March 2024). Buy tickets from ticket machines next to the bus stop or on the bus. It runs from outside Arrivals, down Av de Kansas City to the main railway station, then loops with four stops around the south edge of city centre to the main bus station at Plaza de Armas. Total journey 35 min.\nFor going from Seville to the airport: The bus EA departs in front of the bus station Plaza de Armas where the city buses depart (not downstairs!).\nRide apps\nUse the local\nCabify\napp, Uber or Bolt. Their designated pick-up area is on the ground level of the parking garage right next to the left outside of arrivals.\nTaxis\nto the town centre really shouldn't cost more than €25 for two of you, though they'll make out it's more today for the fiesta of St Strabismus and because your luggage is left-handed. However, taxi fares are officially regulated.\nJerez de la Frontera Airport\n(\nXRY\nIATA\n) is south of Seville and can be reached in 1 hour driving. Other airports around are in\nFaro\n(\nFAO\nIATA\n) and\nMálaga\n(\nAGP\nIATA\n).\nBy carpooling\n[\nedit\n]\nA common option is using carpooling such as\nBlaBlaCar\n, a safe transportation method used by many locals. In\nAndalusia\nyou usually get a better price using Blablacar than travelling by train or intercity bus.\nBy train\n[\nedit\n]\nAVE trains blur across Spain hourly from\nMadrid\nPuerta de Atocha, taking 2 hr 40 min to Seville via\nCiudad Real\n, Puertollano and\nCordoba\n. From Malaga its a single train ticket, with a stop to reverse direction in Cordoba. Travel from Jaen, Granada and Algeciras (for Morocco) usually means a change. Travel time from Cordoba is normally under 50 min, but an occasional slow train takes 1 hr 40 min and continues to\nJerez de la Frontera\nand\nCadiz\n. There are no trains across the nearby border with Portugal.\n37.39231\n-5.9752\n2\nSeville Santa Justa Station\n(\non Av de Kansas City 1 km east of city centre\n).\nIt's a modern, roomy building with luggage lockers, cafés and a TIC. The airport bus stops here. Uber pickup seems to be slightly off site .\n(\nupdated Mar 2024\n)\nBy car\n[\nedit\n]\nDriving is also always an option for long distance travel in Spain, but isn't as convenient or as useful once in town. Public transportation works fine in the city, and most of the main tourist points are walking distance, so it is recommended finding a lodging with a garage or else researching the area for parking places before the trip.\nDriving in the old city is tricky but possible.\nThere is very cheap parking available across the street from Av. de Málaga, 12. The lot is unguarded and if there is no agent in the booth then the entrance to the lot is free of charge. Do not give money to the panhandlers loitering outside pretending they are lot attendants. If they have not receipt to give you then its a scam. Be sure leave absolutely nothing in the car.

There are 450 tickets available a day, of which 60% are bookable online, with the remaining allocated to those who turn up. You can get to the park either by renting a car and driving to the area where there is a small car park (€3 for parking) or by public transport where from San Sebastian, the trip to Urederra can be broken into two legs.\nThe first leg is to Alsasua, which is easily reached by train or bus from San Sebastian, each taking roughly 90 minutes.\nBus timetables for Alsa\nare available on their website. However, the Alsa bus stop in Alsasua is not marked (and worse its location on a map may be incorrectly marked as being on Calle San Juan) but it is outside a residential home for elderly people on\nCalle Idertzagain\n.\nThe second leg involves a 30-minute taxi ride (€40 one way) from Alsasua, (+34 608776154, Taxi Goikoetxea - Spanish-speaking only) to Baquedano.

From 28 million years ago, submerged\nvolcanoes\ngrew, but as the seabed is 2,500 m (8,200 ft) deep it took another 12 million years before the first island of\nFuerteventura\nbroke the surface. A string of islands then emerged further north and 4 million years ago these coalesced to form Lanzarote, while sea erosion broke their link to Fuerteventura and\nLa Graciosa\n. Volcanic activity continued but its focus shifted ever westward, throwing up the other Canary Islands, with Gomera and Hierro active to this day. Lanzarote became quiet, life slowly colonised it, and its surface weathered to a fine gravel suitable for small-scale agriculture. There was no reason to expect future eruptions, ever.\nThis island lies only 130 km (81 mi) from\nNorth Africa\n, and genetics, culture and carbon dating indicate settlement by Berbers around 1000 BC. The\nPhoenicians\nand\nRomans\ntraded here, but\nEurope\ntook no interest until 1312, when the\nGenoese\nnavigator Lanceloto Malocello arrived. Mapmakers recorded \"Insula de Lançarotus Marocelus\" – hence Lanzarote – and it was his thereafter not the aboriginal inhabitants, as they were systematically carted off into slavery. In 1402 mercenaries acting for\nCastille\ncaptured the island, in 1404 it acquired a cathedral, and eventually, it was governed by mainland\nPortugal\nthen\nSpain\n. Pirates of other nations repeatedly attacked and several defensive castillos were built, and still stand.\nBecause Lanzarote's volcanic peaks are low – seldom much above 500 m (1,600 ft) – they don't draw the rain as on the lusher islands, and agriculture struggles with an arid climate. Nevertheless, the south of the island was sufficiently fertile to grow grain, exported as a cash crop to Tenerife and Gran Canaria until 1730. Then the volcanoes' second disadvantage was made clear when a line of them erupted, and kept on erupting for six years. Their lava destroyed the most fertile farmland and a score of villages and farmsteads. Why, after so long? The Canaries are part of the Africa tectonic plate and it's believed that a hot plume bunsen-burns upon it, appearing to move west as Africa shifts east, but the re-activation is a puzzle. The people of 1730 knew about Trade Winds, the Gulf Stream and so on, but it took another 200 years to map the global weather systems and ocean gyres powering these phenomena. Similarly today we observe the surface effects of vulcanism and plate tectonics, but await a 21st century Humboldt to map the \"deep earth weather\" below the planet's crust.\nThe eruptions followed by drought prompted mass migration to the Americas, but the transatlantic trade was a lifeline, and tomatoes, potatoes, maize and prickly pears made their way east. (This last has a parasite, the cochineal insect source of carmine red dye, so there was briefly a lucrative trade in this until synthetic dyes replaced it.) Not much happened for another two centuries, and in 1936 the Canaries were so remote that a troublesome army officer was \"promoted\" here to keep him out of the way. But not remote enough, as his name was Franco and he teamed up with a like-minded colleague in\nMorocco\nto launch the Spanish Civil War. It was only towards the end of his regime in the 1970s that Spain modernised and promoted tourism on its mainland and islands, and wide-bodied jets put the Canaries within reach of chilly northern countries.\nThis was a mixed blessing and Lanzarote risked submerging beneath ticky-tacky concrete developments as so much of the Mediterranean coast has done. One who campaigned for sustainable low-rise development was local artist César Manrique (1919–1992). He also played a key role in having the island declared to be part of the\nUNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves\nin 1993.\nClimate\n[\nedit\n]\nLanzarote\nClimate chart (\nexplanation\n)\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\n16\n21\n14\n17\n22\n15\n12\n23\n15\n4.1\n24\n16\n1.3\n25\n18\n0.2\n27\n19\n0.1\n29\n21\n0.6\n30\n22\n1.9\n29\n21\n13\n27\n20\n16\n24\n17\n22\n22\n16\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °C\nPrecipitation\n+\nSnow\ntotals in mm\nSource:\nWikipedia\n.

Usually in February, the weekend before Ash Wednesday is consistently the loudest and most eventful so be sure to check the calendar. Singing, dancing and costumes run for the whole week. Informal groups (\nchirigotas\n,\ncuartetos\n,\ncoros\n,\ncomparsas\nand\nromanceros\n) sing at the old town streets, usually with strong critics on local, national and international politics, the jet set, and just about anything/anybody, up to the Royal Family. Make your travel plans early as most accommodation gets booked months in advance and be prepared to spend almost double for the week of Carnaval. One way to experience Carnaval on the dime, and perhaps the preferred way of Andalusian locals, is to board an afternoon train heading to Cadiz, spend the night singing and dancing, then catch the first train back in the morning. Expect singing, dancing, costumes and drinking on all trains. Sleeping on the public beach is also another popular option, though be sure to bring a blanket or sleeping bag, both of which can be stored in lockers at the train station; expect company and use common sense.\nSemana Santa\n(Easter or Holy Week) is less formal than in\nSevilla\n, and probably more authentic and emotive an experience for that."

However, many shops and restaurants are closed from early-August to early September. During this time, you will find the most expensive hotel rates (outside of conference times such as the Mobile World Congress), and the city is devoid of locals, as the vast majority of residents go on vacation in August and leave the heat and humidity to the hordes of arriving tourists. This is also one of the highest periods of home break-ins, as criminals know that many places are unoccupied for an entire month.\nWhile Barcelona has decent, albeit crowded beaches, the locals will be very appreciative if visitors do not consider Barcelona a beach resort and absolutely do not wear beachwear when visiting churches, restaurants, etc. If you only want a beach, and a good beach at that, head south to\nCosta Daurada\n, north to\nCosta Brava\nor out to sea for the\nBalearic Islands\n.\nBarcelona can be visited off-season and despite the cold weather, is a lovely city even in the winter months of January and February, as long as the possibility of rain is low.

But over the past few years, the number of alternative accommodations for more experienced, individual travellers has steadily been growing: designer hotels, fully equipped apartments, aparthotels and fincas to name a few.\nFincas\n[\nedit\n]\nRural tourism\n: Also known as \"Agroturismo\". Refers to farmhouses and country estates built before 1960, still being used for agriculture but, of course, fully refurbished and modernized. Just perfect for families with children.\n\"Rural Hotel\", \"Turisme d'Interior\" and \"Petit Hotel\" on the other hand are generally former mansions and manor-houses located in smaller towns such as Sòller, Lloseta, Deià or Campanet. They offer a limited number of rooms for guests, mostly 4-star service with an excellent cuisine, Spa services, etc.\nHotels\n[\nedit\n]\nAlthough the vast majority are 3- and 4-star hotels, the island does offer excellent 5-star hotels and resorts, small and trendy Designer Hotels next to Palma's shopping district as well as charming city hotels in the old city centre of\nPalma de Mallorca\n.\nIf you prefer to stay in your own apartment, but don't want to miss the hotel's daily entertainment programme, sports and shows in the evening, then consider staying in an aparthotel. Most of them are in the north (\nAlcudia\n, Playa de Muro) or on the east coast of the island (Cala Millor, Cala d'Or) and offer a wide range of services.\nCamping\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are no commercial camp grounds in Mallorca, but there are some recreation areas with toilets and sometimes with showers where camping is allowed.\nVilla rentals\n[\nedit\n]\nRenting a villa is an excellent, often inexpensive way of enjoying Mallorca's more secluded locations. These are generally found on the western and northern sides of the island. There are several choices, from  \"casitas\" that are small and offer no additional services, to those which are classed as \"luxury\", and offer a wide range of additional features such as a maid service, breakfast and hire cars."

The lot is unguarded and if there is no agent in the booth then the entrance to the lot is free of charge. Do not give money to the panhandlers loitering outside pretending they are lot attendants. If they have not receipt to give you then its a scam. Be sure leave absolutely nothing in the car. Seville in general is known for car break-ins."

However, many shops and restaurants are closed from early-August to early September. During this time, you will find the most expensive hotel rates (outside of conference times such as the Mobile World Congress), and the city is devoid of locals, as the vast majority of residents go on vacation in August and leave the heat and humidity to the hordes of arriving tourists. This is also one of the highest periods of home break-ins, as criminals know that many places are unoccupied for an entire month.\nWhile Barcelona has decent, albeit crowded beaches, the locals will be very appreciative if visitors do not consider Barcelona a beach resort and absolutely do not wear beachwear when visiting churches, restaurants, etc. If you only want a beach, and a good beach at that, head south to\nCosta Daurada\n, north to\nCosta Brava\nor out to sea for the\nBalearic Islands\n.\nBarcelona can be visited off-season and despite the cold weather, is a lovely city even in the winter months of January and February, as long as the possibility of rain is low. Given the high humidity, 19–23 °C (66–73 °F) is considered comfortable weather, which is usually the temperature from May to June, and from late August to October. These are the best times to visit the city.  Anything warmer than this can feel too hot, and the period from November to April is quite chilly and at times gloomy."

    "text": "Understand\n[\nedit\n]\nCatalonia borders\nFrance\nand\nAndorra\nto the north along the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean Sea to the east,\nValencia\nto the south and\nAragon\nto the west. Its capital is the famous city of\nBarcelona\n.\nCatalonia is today an autonomous region within\nSpain\n, but in fact was part of the Crown of Aragon which predates Spain (the Crown of Catalonia-Aragon and the Crown of Castile-León united to form Spain). Even today, the flag of Catalonia uses the colours of standard of the Crown of Aragon. In 1714, after the War of the Spanish Succession, Catalonia had all its institutions, language and rights suppressed. The region gained its current autonomous status first during the era of the Second Spanish Republic (1930s), but would lose its autonomous status again following the rise of Francisco Franco to power in 1936. Franco was a fascist who desired a strong unified Spanish identity, and proceeded to ban expressions of regional cultures, as well as regional languages, thus making it illegal to speak the Catalan language from 1936–1975. Following Franco's death and the transition to democracy, the local languages and cultures were legalised once more. Catalonia once again gained autonomous status, and the Catalan language gained co-official status with Spanish within the region. It continues to press for more political and economic autonomy, mainly in defence of its culture and language and in the form of the right of the Catalan government to collect its own taxes and spend them as it sees fit.\nCatalonia has seen many demonstrations in favour of its independence from Spain; such as the 2013 Catalan Way, 400 km long. A consultation on independence was deemed illegal by Madrid in 2014. A referendum in 2017 got 90% vote in favour of independence on a low voter turnout, but this was again declared illegal by the Spanish government, which attempted to suppress it with police violence at various polling places, and by blocking access to websites with referendum information. After the referendum, the Catalan Parliament declared an independent republic, and on the same day the Spanish Senate voted to enforce direct rule over the region, suspending the regional government. The future political status of Catalonia is uncertain, but so far the pro-independence movement poses no threat to any tourist, and should not discourage travel to the region.\nTourist information\n[\nedit\n]\nCatalonia Tourism\nwebsite"

Occitan (Aranese) is an official language in the Aran Valley.\nCatalan (\ncatalà\n) is the native language of Catalonia, co-official with Spanish and Aranese. Catalan is also spoken in Andorra, the Balearics, Valencia (where it is called Valencian), La Franja (the eastern strip of\nAragon\n),\nAlghero\nin\nSardinia\n, and Roussillon (sometimes called\nCatalunya Nord\n, an area that corresponds roughly with the department of\nPyrénées-Orientales\n). In everyday use, 12% of the population claim to use both Spanish and Catalan equally, while 36% mainly use Spanish and 46% mainly use Catalan. There is a significant difference between the Barcelona metropolitan area (and, to a lesser extent, the Tarragona area), where Spanish is more spoken than Catalan, and the rest of Catalonia, where Catalan clearly prevails over Spanish.\nVisitors who speak Spanish should note that it is called\ncastellano\n(Catalan\ncastellà\n) and that while most people in Catalonia are bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, and are required to learn both languages in school, some people may be reluctant to speak Spanish for political reasons. Nevertheless, locals tend to be more understanding towards foreigners than Spaniards from other regions, and are willing to speak to foreigners in Spanish. Replying in Catalan to a question asked in Spanish is the way to inform the other party that the conversation may continue in Catalan if desired. If you do not speak Catalan, just politely say that you do not understand, and there will be no problem in most cases. At any rate avoid disparaging comments towards the Catalan language or even insinuating it might be a \"dialect\" rather than a language. Learning a few words of Catalan will certainly endear you to Catalan speakers.\nAranese, a subdialect of Gascon (Occitan), is a minority language and only spoken by a couple of thousand people in\nVal d'Aran\nin north-west Catalonia. In 2006, it gained official status.\nAs in the rest of Spain, English is not widely spoken, though staff working at major hotels and the main tourist attractions know enough English to communicate.\nFrench\nis widely spoken as a second or third language in the areas near the border with France. By necessity, Catalan speakers tend to be more multilingual than their peers in most of Spain. Don't be surprised to hear some light Andalusian tinge to the Spanish of some, especially those working in tourism. Catalonia has attracted economic migrants from the rest of Spain since it industrialized and continues to do so."

About a half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understands it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish. However, most signs are indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language. Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities. Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese. On the other hand, FGC announcements – either regular or disruptions – will be made only in Catalan, and disruption announcements on RENFE's network will usually be made only in Spanish. As in most other cities, any attempt by visitors to use the native languages is always appreciated. Most locals are bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, and instinctively address foreigners in Spanish. Catalan is a separate Romance language, not a dialect, and sounds closer to Italian, Portuguese and French in many ways. Avoid referring to Catalan as a dialect, which will offend Catalans.\nYou might find some locals answer in Catalan after being asked in Spanish, that's not because they are being rude but because they assume you are bilingual. In Catalonia, it's not uncommon to hear people code switching between different languages in the same conversation. In case you can't understand what they are saying, tell them you don't speak Catalan and politely ask them to repeat it in Spanish or English.\nThe main cause of Spanish and Catalan social bilingualism in modern Catalonia is a large scale immigration process from the rest of Spain, which occurred over the 20th century, as Catalonia started a significant industrialization which demanded an increased workforce from elsewhere. 60% of the people in Catalonia use Spanish as their first language, and 40% use Catalan. The issues regarding language, national identity, and politics are like politics anywhere.\nIn tourist areas, almost all shops and bars have some English speaking staff. People will generally make an effort to try to help you if you speak English. If you are a native English speaker, you will have few problems, as Barcelona hosts many tourists."

    "text": "Understand\n[\nedit\n]\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nThe oldest remains discovered in the Basque Country are made of stone, dating from the Paleotlithic period (150,000 before Christ). The Neolithic period (4,500 to 2,500 BC) brought about a major change in people's lifestyle: the inhabitants built settlements and began to farm the land and raise livestock. In ancient times, today's Euskal Herria and adjacent areas were inhabited by ancestors of Basques who the Greek historian Strabon considered savages and warriors.\nThe land of Vascones became a kingdom in the ninth century when the nobles chose Iñigo (824-852) from the Aritza dynasty as king.\nThe kingdom underwent many changes over the next few centuries under Castilian King Ferninand the Catholic invaded and subdued by arms peninsular Navarre Kingdom in 1512.\nFrom the 12th to the 15th centuries villas (towns) and cities emerged, also with their own local fueros or charters and rights granted by kings. It was during this period that the so-called \"foral territories\" were created and agreements reached with the king, by which he would have authority over the land in exchange for respecting the territorial self-governments or fueros and rights.\nThe 19th century is characterised by a gradual loss of rights for the Basque people. The Kingdom of Navarre was incorporated as another province in Spain and the other three provinces of the south refused to become a single province, and therefore retained provisional status.\nIn the late 19th century new ideologies and political movements came into existence, such as socialism but especially Basque nationalism for the restoration of the rights and privileges of the Basque people, as did labour unions.\nThe first 3 decades of the 20th century came a flurry of political activity, followed by the military uprising led by Franco and a long civil war (1936–1939). In 1936 the Spanish Congress (Cortes españolas) passed the Basque Statute of Autonomy and Euskadi reestablished its self-government that had been demanding since the abolition of the rights and fueros. The entire Basque Country fell to Franco's troops in July 1937.\nThe Franco dictatorship (1939–1975) was a dark chapter. As the Basque country had been among the centres of anti-Franco activity and the Basque language was seen as a threat for Franco's vision of Spain, Basque cultural expressions, including the language, were banned. In part as a reaction to that, ETA (Euskadi ta Askatasuna; \"Basque country and freedom\") formed to violently oppose first the Franco regime and then its democratic successors and fight for an independent Basque country. With the death of Franco and transitioning to democracy, the Basque language was legalised once more, and gained co-official status with Spanish within the region. ETA declared a ceasefire in 2010, and declared its dissolution in 2018, but open wounds still remain, especially since even the democratic governments of the 1980s used some extra-legal measures in fighting ETA.\nGeography\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Basque area (Basque:\nEuskal Herria\n) is divided into three different legal and political entities, of which the first is what this article is about:\nEuskadi\n, the Autonomous Community of Euskadi comprises the territories or provinces of Alava, Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa. The capital cities are Vitoria-Gasteiz, Bilbao and Donostia-San Sebastián in the same order.\nNafarroa\n, the Autonomous Community of Navarre. The capital is Pamplona-Iruña.\nIparralde\n(\"the northern part\") or continental Euskal Herria, the French Basque Country in\nPyrénées-Atlantiques\n, includes the territories of Lapurdi (French:\nLabourd\n), Zuberoa (French:\nSoule\n) and Behenafarroa (Lower Navarre; French:\nBasse Navarre\n). The capital cities are Baiona, Maule and Donibane Garazi (French:\nBayonne\n,\nMaule\n, and\nSaint Jean Pied de Port\n, respectively).\nTwo of these administrative regions (A.C. of Euskadi and the A.C. of Navarre) are in Hegoalde (literally, the southern part in the Basque language) or peninsular Euskal Herria. The southern and northern Basque Country are divided into two states: Spain and France.\nEuskal Herria is therefore the combination of seven historical territories divided into these three administrative regions.\nAlthough today the term Euskal Herria defines a historical and cultural entity rather than a unified political or administrative region, it does share a significant amount of common heritage, culture, language, history and identity.\nOften the term Basque Country is used to refer only to the autonomous zone (\nEuskadi\n), but mostly it refers to all the Basque region (\nEuskal Herria\n), including Navarre and the Basque territories in France."

You can only get to Gibraltar from Birmingham, London or Manchester via England.\nBy train\n[\nedit\n]\nMálaga is connected to the RENFE high-speed network. The AVE runs here every hour. You can get to Barcelona and Madrid from Malaga. The next transfer station is in\nCórdoba\n. There are only a few other trains to the Costa des Sol. A train runs every two hours to Seville, one from time to time to Ronda.\nWith the RENFE train C-1 you can go from there to the centre of the capital or southwest along the coast to Fuengirola.

At the same time there are also good country roads, on which you need a little longer to get to your destination. You can get to Malaga on the A-45 from Cordoba. The traffic will be distributed near\nAntequera\n, where the east–west connection A-92 from Seville to Cordoba crosses the A-45.\nBy bus\n[\nedit\n]\nThe bus network on the Costa del Sol is quite well developed. You always try to be on time, but this is often hardly possible, as the buses always drive through built-up areas and are often delayed due to traffic. Also, if you want to cover longer distances by bus, you have to change frequently. The buses are quite modern equipped, also have air conditioning. Every larger town also has a bus station where you can change trains. Since many Spaniards also use this bus, the buses can get quite full."

    "text": "History\n[\nedit\n]\nThe oldest remains discovered in the Basque Country are made of stone, dating from the Paleotlithic period (150,000 before Christ). The Neolithic period (4,500 to 2,500 BC) brought about a major change in people's lifestyle: the inhabitants built settlements and began to farm the land and raise livestock. In ancient times, today's Euskal Herria and adjacent areas were inhabited by ancestors of Basques who the Greek historian Strabon considered savages and warriors.\nThe land of Vascones became a kingdom in the ninth century when the nobles chose Iñigo (824-852) from the Aritza dynasty as king.\nThe kingdom underwent many changes over the next few centuries under Castilian King Ferninand the Catholic invaded and subdued by arms peninsular Navarre Kingdom in 1512.\nFrom the 12th to the 15th centuries villas (towns) and cities emerged, also with their own local fueros or charters and rights granted by kings. It was during this period that the so-called \"foral territories\" were created and agreements reached with the king, by which he would have authority over the land in exchange for respecting the territorial self-governments or fueros and rights.\nThe 19th century is characterised by a gradual loss of rights for the Basque people. The Kingdom of Navarre was incorporated as another province in Spain and the other three provinces of the south refused to become a single province, and therefore retained provisional status.\nIn the late 19th century new ideologies and political movements came into existence, such as socialism but especially Basque nationalism for the restoration of the rights and privileges of the Basque people, as did labour unions.\nThe first 3 decades of the 20th century came a flurry of political activity, followed by the military uprising led by Franco and a long civil war (1936–1939). In 1936 the Spanish Congress (Cortes españolas) passed the Basque Statute of Autonomy and Euskadi reestablished its self-government that had been demanding since the abolition of the rights and fueros. The entire Basque Country fell to Franco's troops in July 1937.\nThe Franco dictatorship (1939–1975) was a dark chapter. As the Basque country had been among the centres of anti-Franco activity and the Basque language was seen as a threat for Franco's vision of Spain, Basque cultural expressions, including the language, were banned. In part as a reaction to that, ETA (Euskadi ta Askatasuna; \"Basque country and freedom\") formed to violently oppose first the Franco regime and then its democratic successors and fight for an independent Basque country. With the death of Franco and transitioning to democracy, the Basque language was legalised once more, and gained co-official status with Spanish within the region. ETA declared a ceasefire in 2010, and declared its dissolution in 2018, but open wounds still remain, especially since even the democratic governments of the 1980s used some extra-legal measures in fighting ETA."

Some low-cost carriers, notably Ryanair, use the airports of\nGirona\n(\nGRO\nIATA\n), nearly 100 km (62 mi) to the north, or\nReus\n(\nREU\nIATA\n), around the same distance to the south, instead. Since Ryanair started operating at BCN, you should check carefully where your flight goes. The three-letter IATA code should be part of your booking process.\nBarcelona International Airport\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nBarcelona El Prat Airport\nBarcelona International Airport\n(\nBCN\nIATA\n), also known as\nEl Prat\n, is a major transport hub, with flights from all over Europe and beyond, is by far the closest airport to the city. To get to the city centre, there are different options. Both terminals have a metro station and the ticket machines before the turnstiles will sell you a Billet aeroport ticket to anywhere in the city by metro (only)for €5.70. You can also reach Barcelona's city centre by train or by bus with a T-casual on a T-mobilitat contactless card. This costs €12.55 for 10 journeys on any Suburban Train (Rodalies), metro (not from the airport), tram, or bus in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, and cannot be shared by more than one person. It is also much cheaper than the Aerobus (€7.25 for a single journey). The train leaves from Terminal 2, and there is a free shuttle from Terminal 1 to terminal 2. Trains run every 30 minutes until around midnight. If you arrive on a late flight, you can get into Barcelona using the N18 night bus, which stops at Plaça d'Espanya on its way to Plaça Catalunya. See the Public Transport section in Get Around below for more information on tickets & passes as there were major changes in 2023.\nGirona–Costa Brava Airport\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Barcelona Bus service runs a shuttle bus from Estació del Nord (which is walking distance to the Arc de Triomf metro stop) in Barcelona to Girona Airport, synchronised with various flight times. A one-way ticket costs €16 and a return ticket costs €25. The journey takes approximately 1 hour 10 minutes. Timetables are available\nonline\n. You can also take a train (you can choose between local\nRodalies\n,\nMedia Distancia\nand high speed  AVE trains with different travel times and price points) to Girona main train station and a local bus from there to the airport.\nReus Airport\n[\nedit\n]\nThe easiest way is to get there is to take the bus run by Hispano Igualadina from the Barcelona Sants bus station to the airport. Bus departures are synchronized with Ryanair plane departures/arrivals. One way ticket costs €13 and a return ticket costs €24. The journey takes from 1 hr 30 min to 1 hr 45 min, depending on the traffic on the motorway. Timetables are available\nonline\n[dead link]\n. A slightly cheaper, yet longer option is to take a train from Barcelona Sants station to Reus and then the local bus no. 50 to the airport. The train costs €7.25 and then the bus costs €2.5. This takes about 2½ hours. Train timetables can be checked at Renfe's\nwebsite\nand the bus timetable is available at the\nwebsite\n[dead link]\nof Reus public transport.\nBarcelona Sants railway station\nBy train\n[\nedit\n]\nSuperfast trains will whiz you to Barcelona from across Spain and France\nBarcelona is well-connected to the Spanish railway network, and to the rest of Europe. High-speed trains run frequently from main station\n41.379112\n2.139878\n2\nBarcelona Sants\n(in the southwest of the city) to Madrid, Seville and Malaga. There are also regular long-distance connections that partially use high-speed infrastructure to all major Spanish cities. The station is also served by many regional lines including\nR1\nR2\nR2\nSUD\nR2\nNORD\nR3\nR4\nR11\nThe historic\n41.384\n2.186\n3\nEstació de França\nnow mostly serves regional trains.\nDirect regular\nhigh-speed train service\ngoes to destinations in France. In addition to two daily TGV services from\nParis\n(travel time ~7 hr to Barcelona), there is a daily service from\nLyon\n(5 hr), and a daily service from\nMarseille\n(4 hr). Prices start at €39, so even though the train could take longer than a flight, it is often a cheaper, more relaxed alternative and less climately harmful option.\nThe former Talgo trains from Montpellier to Barcelona and Cartagena via Portbou ceased to run when direct high speed services started. It is still possible to travel via Cerbère/Portbou using local trains, but it's cumbersome, painfully slow and timetable coordination at the border is awful; however it may be the only alternative if all TGVs are fully booked. Also, if booked in advance, TGV can be way cheaper than using these local trains. However, for travelers using Eurail and Interrail passes these local routes are a useful way to avoid the high additional reservation fees on the international TGVs, which can be almost as high as an advance-booked standalone ticket on some of the longer routes.\nThere is also a less-known rail line over the Pyrenees to Toulouse. There is roughly one train every 3 hours on the Spanish side and one every two or four on the French side, including a sleeper train from Paris (with a branch to Portbou which splits at Toulouse: check all timetables to see whether route is faster, it greatly depends on waiting times at the border). Purchasing tickets for this route can be tricky. The Spanish line is considered a commuter line despite being far away from Barcelona and does not appear in any global European timetable, so it is impossible to get an international CIV ticket, every portion must be purchased separately. Also, for southbound travel, the Latour-de-Carol station only sells SNCF tickets so the Spanish portion must be bought directly at the ticket inspector, cash only. The journey takes 7–8 hours (including transfer) and costs roughly €30.\nThe launch of the high-speed service spelled the end of the overnight sleeper-car service called\nTrenhotel\nbetween Barcelona and Paris.\nTrenhotels\nstill do, however, run between Barcelona and\nGranada\n,\nA Coruña\nand\nVigo\n.\nThe security checks are taken seriously and may take some time. Arrive in advance, and do not bring anything that could be interpreted as potential weapon as it may be destroyed (knife, tools…).\nBarcelona is a popular port of call for cruise ships\nBy boat\n[\nedit\n]\nThe city's port is one of the busiest on the Mediterranean.\nLarge cruise ships dock 1–2 km (0.62–1.24 mi) to the southwest. Many of them offer bus-shuttles to locations at the south end of La Rambla. The ferries dock almost directly on the Ramblas.\nThere are regular ferry connections with the\nBalearic Islands\n(\nAlcúdia\n,\nCiutadella de Menorca\n,\nIbiza City\n,\nSant Antoni de Portmany\n,\nMahón\n,\nPalma de Mallorca\n),\nItaly\n(\nGenoa\n,\nPorto Torres\nand\nCivitavecchia\nfor\nRome\n) and\nTangier\n, in\nMorocco\n. From Rome (\nCivitavecchia\n) it is actually cheaper to take the ferry than a bus.\nSome of the largest shipping companies includes\nBaleària\n,\nGrimaldi Lines\nand\nTrasmediterranea\nbut there are several smaller companies as well.\nBy bus\n[\nedit\n]\nAll bus connections are at\n41.394142\n2.182742\n4\nBarcelona del Nord\n(\nBarcelona Nord\n,\nEstacion del Norte\n) station (\n☏\n+34 902 260 606\n). This includes national (e.g. 18 buses per day from Madrid) and international routes.\nFlixbus\nruns coach services between Barcelona Nord and London Victoria Coach Station, via Paris and Toulouse. They also connect to Amsterdam, Cologne, Brussels and many UK cities. They can be very cheap, but be prepared for a 24-26 hour coach ride from London! There is a small service fee. There may or may not be plug sockets or Wi-Fi on board. Flixbus recommend that you be at your departure point at least 30 minutes before departure time (except London Victoria where you are required to arrive 60 minutes before departure).\nBy car\n[\nedit\n]\nSeveral main roads connect Barcelona to France and to the rest of Spain. Traffic is usually relatively light outside of peak hours. Free parking spaces can be found a few metro stops from the center of the city.\nBlue parking spaces are paid M-Sa 09:00-14:00 and 16:00-20:00. At some crossroads, the pay time starts at 08:00. Anyone can use a blue space, but they aren't that easy to find. You pay at the meter and put the ticket on the dashboard. Green parking spaces are for residents only. White parking spaces are free at all times, but there aren't any in the city centre.\nCity car parks\nare found throughout the city."

The capital cities are Vitoria-Gasteiz, Bilbao and Donostia-San Sebastián in the same order.\nNafarroa\n, the Autonomous Community of Navarre. The capital is Pamplona-Iruña.\nIparralde\n(\"the northern part\") or continental Euskal Herria, the French Basque Country in\nPyrénées-Atlantiques\n, includes the territories of Lapurdi (French:\nLabourd\n), Zuberoa (French:\nSoule\n) and Behenafarroa (Lower Navarre; French:\nBasse Navarre\n).

The southern and northern Basque Country are divided into two states: Spain and France.\nEuskal Herria is therefore the combination of seven historical territories divided into these three administrative regions.\nAlthough today the term Euskal Herria defines a historical and cultural entity rather than a unified political or administrative region, it does share a significant amount of common heritage, culture, language, history and identity.\nOften the term Basque Country is used to refer only to the autonomous zone (\nEuskadi\n), but mostly it refers to all the Basque region (\nEuskal Herria\n), including Navarre and the Basque territories in France."

From the region's location, you might expect this language to be a blend of Spanish and French, but Basque is unrelated to either of them and in fact, seems to be unrelated to\nany\nother known language.\nBasque's large collection of grammatical cases, agglutinative morphology, and extensive use of suffixes to construct simple sentences make it a\nnotoriously difficult\nlanguage to master. Although the average traveller can get by with Spanish, any attempts to speak Basque or learn a few phrases will go a long way. The Basques are well aware of the fact that their language is difficult for foreigners and they don't expect you to be fluent in it.\nIn terms of foreign languages, the Basque Country is a bit of an anomaly in Spain. While the rest of the country is not known for its fluency in languages other than Spanish, Basques are more likely to be polyglots. English is not widely spoken, but staff members in major hotels and tourist areas will definitely know a few essential sentences, and most young people can carry a decent conversation.

To get to the city centre, there are different options. Both terminals have a metro station and the ticket machines before the turnstiles will sell you a Billet aeroport ticket to anywhere in the city by metro (only)for €5.70. You can also reach Barcelona's city centre by train or by bus with a T-casual on a T-mobilitat contactless card. This costs €12.55 for 10 journeys on any Suburban Train (Rodalies), metro (not from the airport), tram, or bus in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, and cannot be shared by more than one person. It is also much cheaper than the Aerobus (€7.25 for a single journey). The train leaves from Terminal 2, and there is a free shuttle from Terminal 1 to terminal 2. Trains run every 30 minutes until around midnight. If you arrive on a late flight, you can get into Barcelona using the N18 night bus, which stops at Plaça d'Espanya on its way to Plaça Catalunya.

Check the\nwebsite\nto see the borders and which cars are allowed (with time, it gets more restrictive).\nPublic transport\n[\nedit\n]\nIf you are going to take more than a few journeys on public transit, a Barik card would be a good investment. It is convenient, and can save you a considerable amount compared to single tickets. It is valid on the Metro, bus, tram, Euskotren services and on local Renfe trains in Bizkaia (Bilbao metro area). It can be bought from machines at Metro/Euskotren stations and from other outlets displaying the Barik sign. The card costs €3.00, and at the time of purchase it can be charged up with whatever amount is desired. It is easy to add further credit in the machines in Metro stations or by using the Barik NFC phone app with a credit card in €5 increments. A Barik cardless phone app is being piloted at July 2023 but is not generally available.\nBarik cards can be used by more than one person on buses - so you may see a family of four swiping their card four times. They are valid through the province of Bizkaia (eng Biscay) and work on a zonal basis for the Metro, EuskoTren & Bizkaibus. Local Buses & Trams are a flat fare. The Barik card is valid outside Bizkaia on the EuskoTren to\nSan Sebastián\nand the Dbus buses there. It is also valid on the trams in\nVitoria-Gasteiz\n. The card can only be reloaded at Euskotren stations outside Bizkaia or using Barik NFC phone app.\nWhilst the Barik card is an example of excellent public transport integration.

Trains run every couple of minutes at peak hours, and the stations are mostly very close together, meaning a lot of stops if you are going on a long journey. Single journey tickets cost from €1.70-1.95, depending on how many zones your journey covers. If making more than a couple of journeys you are advised to get a Barik card, place your card over the reader in order to enter at the automatic gates, and do this again at the end of the journey when exiting.

Nonetheless, Galicians trace their cultural ancestry back to Celtic tribes which began to settle around 1000 BC. Celtic Civilization in Galicia had its heyday between 600 and 25 BC, up to when Galicia fell under the power of the Roman Empire. Still, a weak Romanization meant the consolidation of a hybrid culture, bearing strong Celtic traits.\nGalicia is considered \"the first country in Europe\", following the establishment of the Swabian Kingdom in 411 AD. The Swabian dynasty lasted until 585, when it was replaced by the Visigoth dynasty. With the Muslim occupation of southern Iberia from 711 and the subsequent dismantlement of the Visigoth Empire, Galicia began to consolidate itself as one of the main Christian Kingdoms in Medieval Iberia, namely thanks to the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela.\nGalicia was annexed to Castile (Spain) in 1486; this was the beginning of the so-called \"Dark Centuries\" (\nSéculos Escuros\n). Since then, Galicia has attempted to regain its independence or achieve greater autonomy up to this day. Galicia only lost its formal denomination of \"kingdom\" in 1833. There was a failed attempt to proclaim a Galician Republic in 1931.\nSince 1981, the 'Galician Statute of Autonomy' grants Galicia extended autonomy within the framework of the Spanish State. Galicia has its own national parliament, president and symbols, although it is curtailed from international representation. Many Galicians claim for a greater autonomy or even independence; others are happy with the current arrangements.\nGalicians take great pride in their cultural heritage and architecture. You will find plenty of good examples of this by just 'getting lost' in any Galician city, town or village. Santiago de Compostela is a must, but it is also a good idea to wonder off the tourist track, as this is safe, unexpensive and highly rewarding. Furthermore, Galicia is well-known for its splendid landscapes, ranging from spectacular sea views to mountain areas.\nSpain is divided into provinces; those within Galicia are A Coruña, Lugo, Ourense and Pontevedra. Attractions within each province are listed under their main city. It is worth travelling some distance to avoid hearing a Galician expound on the distinction between its 137\nconcellos\n, 53\ncomarcas\nor\nbisbarras\n, and innumerable\nparroquias\n(parishes) further divided into\nlugares\nor settlements."

In the whole region, there's no places for\nhorizontal\nabseiling (like moving over a rope above a river from one side of canyon to another).

A city that has been marked by Spain's varied and tumultuous history, Madrid has some of Europe's most impressive cultural and architectural heritage, which includes grand avenues, plazas, buildings and monuments, world-class art galleries and museums, highly popular football teams, and cultural events of international fame for everyone. Madrid is also renowned for gastronomic delights and a nightlife lasting up until dawn.\nMadrid is more often than not disregarded by tourists who gravitate to other parts of the country. But though it may appear to lack some of the breathtaking architecture of\nBarcelona\n, the frenetic energy of London and Berlin, or the flair of Paris and Rome, Madrid is a massive treasure chest that has something for those who are willing to get off the beaten tourist tracks. It might not be the most sought-after city, but those who seek out what Madrid has to offer will discover a city of unexpected beauty. Be aware that the transportation infrastructure is often broken, dysfunctional, or overly complicated. Whether you are traveling in the city or getting a long-distance train, take extra time because it will not be as simple as in other European cities or what your map app is telling you."

Galician has a somewhat different accent from standard Portuguese and has unique colloquialisms and traces of former cultures, using a number of pre-Indo-European, Celtic and Germanic words not found in standard Portuguese.\nGalician (or\nGalego\n) is Galicia's own language. Both Galician and Spanish are official in Galicia, as recognized by the Spanish Constitution and the Galician Statute of Autonomy. Galician is understood by the vast majority of the population, and Spanish can be spoken by virtually everyone (although it is heavily influenced by the Galician accent and vocabulary). Travellers should have no problems communicating in Spanish or in standard Portuguese.\nAfter the arrival of the Castilian nobility towards the end of the Middle Ages, Galician disappeared from the public eye and was preserved only privately. It was only in the 19th century that Galician started to be reclaimed in all areas of everyday life. Today, children are taught both Spanish and Galician in school, and the majority of the population speaks Galician normally, although that varies very much depending on the location.\nYoung people study English at school, so they should have at least some basic knowledge of that language, and French is an optional subject for young people. The odd person may speak some German."

In the interior you find impressive stairways, fountains and Patios. It was the setting for the first act of Bizet's opera\nCarmen\n. In 1953 the factory was converted into the main building of Seville University. Just behind the tobacco factory, the María Luisa Park borders the historic centre of Seville to the south.

    "text": "Public transport\n[\nedit\n]\nIf you are going to take more than a few journeys on public transit, a Barik card would be a good investment. It is convenient, and can save you a considerable amount compared to single tickets. It is valid on the Metro, bus, tram, Euskotren services and on local Renfe trains in Bizkaia (Bilbao metro area). It can be bought from machines at Metro/Euskotren stations and from other outlets displaying the Barik sign. The card costs €3.00, and at the time of purchase it can be charged up with whatever amount is desired. It is easy to add further credit in the machines in Metro stations or by using the Barik NFC phone app with a credit card in €5 increments. A Barik cardless phone app is being piloted at July 2023 but is not generally available.\nBarik cards can be used by more than one person on buses - so you may see a family of four swiping their card four times. They are valid through the province of Bizkaia (eng Biscay) and work on a zonal basis for the Metro, EuskoTren & Bizkaibus. Local Buses & Trams are a flat fare. The Barik card is valid outside Bizkaia on the EuskoTren to\nSan Sebastián\nand the Dbus buses there. It is also valid on the trams in\nVitoria-Gasteiz\n. The card can only be reloaded at Euskotren stations outside Bizkaia or using Barik NFC phone app.\nWhilst the Barik card is an example of excellent public transport integration. The same cannot be said about public transport information with no proper citywide map for all modes of transport. Google Maps seems not to have any bus information.

Additionally there is\nL3\noperated by Euskotren (but fully integrated with rest of metro) between Matiko & Kukullaga-Etxebarri connecting to the other two lines at Zazpikaleak(Casco Viejo).  Trains run every couple of minutes at peak hours, and the stations are mostly very close together, meaning a lot of stops if you are going on a long journey. Single journey tickets cost from €1.70-1.95, depending on how many zones your journey covers. If making more than a couple of journeys you are advised to get a Barik card, place your card over the reader in order to enter at the automatic gates, and do this again at the end of the journey when exiting. Barik fares are from €0.48 to €0.62.\nBilbobus\nCity bus service usually red in colour. flat fare. Cheapest with Barik card. Touch in when getting on bus only.\nEuskotren Tranbia\nA green tram from La Casilla to Bolurta. The single line runs along the river passing the Bilbao Guggenheim Museum and also serves the bus station (Bilbio Intermodal) at San Marmes & Albando. Single tickets cost €1.50 from machines at tram stops. Don't forget to validate the ticket on the validator next to the ticket machine before boarding. A cheaper option is to use a Barik card, touch in once per passenger before boarding: do not touch out at the end as it will have already debited your card with the flat fare.\nRenfe Cercanias\n(Basque:Aldiriak) Suburban trains. Three lines C1, C2 & C3 run from Bilbao Abano station & one Cercanias service C4 from La Concordia station (near Abano). The Barik card be used on these services. From Bilbao Abando station lines C1 & C2 head North via Barakaldo to Santurtzi (C1) and Muskiz (C2). Line C3 heads south to Orduna. Additionally line C4 heads south west to La Calzada.

There are also regular long-distance connections that partially use high-speed infrastructure to all major Spanish cities. The station is also served by many regional lines including\nR1\nR2\nR2\nSUD\nR2\nNORD\nR3\nR4\nR11\nThe historic\n41.384\n2.186\n2\nEstació de França\nnow mostly serves regional trains.\nDirect regular\nhigh-speed train service\ngoes to destinations in France. In addition to two daily TGV services from\nParis\n(travel time ~7 hr to Barcelona), there is a daily service from\nLyon\n(5 hr), and a daily service from\nMarseille\n(4 hr). Prices start at €39, so even though the train could take longer than a flight, it is often a cheaper, more relaxed alternative and less climately harmful option.\nThe former Talgo trains from Montpellier to Barcelona and Cartagena via Portbou ceased to run when direct high speed services started. It is still possible to travel via Cerbère/Portbou using local trains, but it's cumbersome, painfully slow and timetable coordination at the border is awful; however it may be the only alternative if all TGVs are fully booked. Also, if booked in advance, TGV can be way cheaper than using these local trains. However, for travelers using Eurail and Interrail passes these local routes are a useful way to avoid the high additional reservation fees on the international TGVs, which can be almost as high as an advance-booked standalone ticket on some of the longer routes.\nThere is also a less-known rail line over the Pyrenees to Toulouse. There is roughly one train every 3 hours on the Spanish side and one every two or four on the French side, including a sleeper train from Paris (with a branch to Portbou which splits at Toulouse: check all timetables to see whether route is faster, it greatly depends on waiting times at the border). Purchasing tickets for this route can be tricky. The Spanish line is considered a commuter line despite being far away from Barcelona and does not appear in any global European timetable, so it is impossible to get an international CIV ticket, every portion must be purchased separately. Also, for southbound travel, the Latour-de-Carol station only sells SNCF tickets so the Spanish portion must be bought directly at the ticket inspector, cash only. The journey takes 7–8 hours (including transfer) and costs roughly €30.\nThe launch of the high-speed service spelled the end of the overnight sleeper-car service called\nTrenhotel\nbetween Barcelona and Paris.\nTrenhotels\nstill do, however, run between Barcelona and\nGranada\n,\nA Coruña\nand\nVigo\n.\nThe security checks are taken seriously and may take some time. Arrive in advance, and do not bring anything that could be interpreted as potential weapon as it may be destroyed (knife, tools…).\nBarcelona is a popular port of call for cruise ships"

The Conde Duque Cultural Centre usually hosts shows, concerts and exhibitions.\nChueca\nis known as the gay district with a very strong personality: new design, trendy shops, cool cafes, pop and electronic music.\nArganzuela\n(\nArganzuela\n)\nOnce a working-class district south of the city centre, Arganzuela is undergoing a massive transformation, thanks to the\nMadrid Río\nurban landscaping project that replaced a city motorway by a unique 6-km long public garden strip on both banks of Río Manzanares, and the\nMatadero\narts and cultural centre.\nMoncloa\n(\nMoncloa\n)\nLocated to the west of the city centre. Due to its proximity to\nUniversidad Complutense\n, the city's main university, Moncloa is associated with students and a student lifestyle, with many cheap bars and discos.\nCiudad Universitaria\nis the area where most of the students reside as there are several dorms in this area. Moreover, the district includes the extensive green area of\nCasa de Campo\n(five times the size of New York's Central Park) that includes Madrid's zoo and an amusement park. Moncloa is also host to a complex of buildings housing the offices of the Prime Minister.\nChamberí and Castellana\n(\nChamberí, Castellana\n)\nChamberí\nis a middle-class residential neighbourhood north of the city centre with few tourist points of interest, but may be a reasonable choice for affordable lodging and dining close to the locals' everyday life.\nPaseo de la Castellana\nis Madrid's most prominent northbound arterial road, lined by company domiciles and office buildings. Admirers of modern architecture will find the tallest and most characteristic high-rise buildings along this avenue.\nSouthern Suburbs\n(Suburbios del sur)\n(\nLatina, Carabanchel, Usera, Puente de Vallecas, Moratalaz, Villaverde, Villa de Vallecas, Vicálvaro\n)\nA group of mostly working-class areas that might look rough around the edges, but are also a mosaic of cultures and traditions; you will hardly find a better place to experience a mix of Spanish culture, Latin American vibes, Chinese food, and everything in between.\nNorthern Suburbs\n(Suburbios del norte)\n(\nChamartín, Tetuán, Fuencarral, Ciudad Lineal, Hortaleza, San Blas, Barajas\n)\nThis vast region hosts everything from working-class ethnic enclaves and sprawling green spaces to towering skyscrapers and some of Madrid's wealthiest and most exclusive residential neighbourhoods.

As a holiday destination, the airport's primary tenants are discount carriers and charter airlines, although limited service on the European national carriers (Air France, British Airways, etc.) is available. Seasonal service (non-daily) is available from New York-JFK on Delta.\nGetting there/away:\nBus\n. Line A express is very convenient, running every 20–25 minutes and stopping at Alameda Principal and Paseo del Parque, where most of the local buses that serve the city stop as well, costs €4 (Oct 2024). The route map for bus A can be seen\nonline\n. The stop names are shown on an electronic display inside the bus so you can tell when to get off. (NOTE Bus & Metro websites are geoblocked outside of Spain)\nFrom the airport you can get a\ntrain\n(C-1 line), that goes to\nMálaga Centro Alameda\nstation in city centre. It costs €1.80 (Dec 2024), runs every 20 to 40 minutes from about 07:00 to 01:00 and takes 8 minutes to reach the María Zambrano station for transfer to Renfe's high-speed AVE service or the main bus station which is right next to the train station. Train route and timetables are\nhere\n.\nA\ntaxi\nto the city centre will cost about €20, a journey to Málaga Port will cost around €25. Taxis can be found at the airport's taxi rank just outside the arrivals hall of Terminal 2. Generally, there are taxis available, although you may have to queue and in summer the queues can be very long.\nMinibus\n. Taxis can carry a maximum of 4 passengers regardless of passenger age. Although this can be cost effective if 4 passengers are travelling together over shorter distances, it can be expensive if travelling in large groups. Licensed minibus transfers can be ordered in advance that carry up to 17 passengers for a fixed fee and will meet you in the arrivals lounge of Terminal 2. Minibus companies can not be flagged down from outside Malaga Airport it is forbidden. A typical single transfer to Marbella will cost around €110.\nRenting a car\nat Málaga's airport is relatively cheap, but it is advisable to book in advance."

You can find it at the foot of the Alkazaba very close to the port. The complex was found by chance while building a house and then excavated. It dates from the first century AD. During the Moorish period, parts of the theater were integrated into the Alkazaba fortress.\nIn Fuengirola you can visit the\nFinca del Secretario\n. The excavation dates from Roman times and contains a curing facility that is still in good condition, but also a thermal bath and a pottery workshop. The Roman apartments and the baths are not original, they are replicas. You can find the excavation on Avda. Nuestro Padre Jesús Cautivo west of the Pajares River.\nIn Marbella you will find the\nVilla Romana de Río Verde\nat the mouth of the Rio Verde, in the west of the city. All that remains of the villa is unfortunately only the floor, a mosaic of black and white tiles. In addition, the beginnings of the walls can still be seen. The archaeological site can be found on Calle del Rio in the east of the Rio Verde river. The site can be visited.\nIn Torrox, at the end of the beach promenade, if you go east, you will find a small excavation from Roman times. The excavation is divided into several small parts. The remains of the\nRoman city of Caviculum\nwere excavated here. There isn't that much to see, but at least the ancient building remains were preserved here and not built over them.\nThe\nBanos de Hedionda\ncan be found at Casares. They are the remains of a sulfur bath from Roman times. Even Julius Caesar is said to have healed his wounds from the long marches on his campaigns of conquest here. His troops also revered the bath for its healing properties. The baths, which are open to the public and can be visited and used, can be found near the village of Gaucín on the right of the Albarra stream.\nMoorish buildings\n[\nedit\n]\nThe most famous buildings from the Moorish period can be seen in Málaga. The\nAlcazaba\nand the\nCastillo de Gibralfaro\ndate from the Moorish period. Both can be visited and guided tours are offered. The buildings testify to the great prosperity of the city in the Moorish times.\nAll over the coast there are still\nwatchtowers\nthat date back to Islamic times. These towers, called Atalaya, were warning towers that were supposed to detect fleets in the Mediterranean. This would then be reported by beacon that troops could be mobilized to repel the impending attack. The towers were manned by only one or a maximum of two soldiers. They are usually on elevations directly on the coast, so that a good view of the Mediterranean was possible and an uninterrupted chain was created between the individual towers. Many names of other buildings and districts still refer to these watchtowers.\nIn the southwest of the city of Fuengirola you can find the fortress\nCastillo de Sohail\n. The original place Fuengirola is said to have formed around them. The name of the city is also said to be derived from Fuen for Fuerte, i.e. fortress. The fortress dates from the time of the Muslim occupation and is said to have been built around 900 AD. You can visit the fortress today. It also serves as a venue for concerts and festivals. The Noches de Castillo, the castle nights, during which pop and rock concerts take place here, are well known.\nThe original\ntown centres\non the Costa del Sol come from the Moorish settlement phase. You can recognize them by the narrow streets that run like a labyrinth through the whole place. These places are also often decorated as it was customary in Moorish times. A nice example is Frigiliana near Nerja or Mijas Pueblo north of Fuengirola."

Over the main entrance, the triangular façade ends in a statue of La Fama (fame). The tobacco factory was then the largest industrial building in Spain. A monopoly assured high income, which is reflected in the factory's architecture and surrounding gardens. Its chapel and prison complement the main building. In the interior you find impressive stairways, fountains and Patios. It was the setting for the first act of Bizet's opera\nCarmen\n. In 1953 the factory was converted into the main building of Seville University. Just behind the tobacco factory, the María Luisa Park borders the historic centre of Seville to the south. Although it's open to the public (as all university buildings are), the building is used for academic purposes.

The buildings testify to the great prosperity of the city in the Moorish times.\nAll over the coast there are still\nwatchtowers\nthat date back to Islamic times. These towers, called Atalaya, were warning towers that were supposed to detect fleets in the Mediterranean. This would then be reported by beacon that troops could be mobilized to repel the impending attack. The towers were manned by only one or a maximum of two soldiers. They are usually on elevations directly on the coast, so that a good view of the Mediterranean was possible and an uninterrupted chain was created between the individual towers. Many names of other buildings and districts still refer to these watchtowers.\nIn the southwest of the city of Fuengirola you can find the fortress\nCastillo de Sohail\n. The original place Fuengirola is said to have formed around them. The name of the city is also said to be derived from Fuen for Fuerte, i.e. fortress. The fortress dates from the time of the Muslim occupation and is said to have been built around 900 AD. You can visit the fortress today. It also serves as a venue for concerts and festivals. The Noches de Castillo, the castle nights, during which pop and rock concerts take place here, are well known.\nThe original\ntown centres\non the Costa del Sol come from the Moorish settlement phase. You can recognize them by the narrow streets that run like a labyrinth through the whole place. These places are also often decorated as it was customary in Moorish times. A nice example is Frigiliana near Nerja or Mijas Pueblo north of Fuengirola."

Bars do not get busy in the city of Ibiza or San Antonio until early evening, about 19:00.\nNearly every bar, particularly in the busier summer months, has \"drink specials\" that will be advertised (more like hawked) on the street outside the bar. These are good options to save some cash in a notoriously expensive destination. Usually this will be a beer and a shot for €5, but the terms vary depending on the area, the time of night, and the bar.\nThe West End, near San Antonio center, is a long, wide street packed with bars and revelers. The party shuts down at around 03:00 or 04:00 here.\nIbiza is most known for its large clubs. Some famous examples are Privilege, Pacha, Eden, Amnesia, and Es Paradis. Most of these clubs have hefty entry fees and the drinks will be extremely expensive. Plan on paying €30-80 for admission (unless you are able to find a special deal from one of the hawkers on the street) and from €15 per drink (prepare yourself to pay €10 for a bottle of water).\nIbiza clubs attract some of the best DJs in the world who play a weekly 'residency' at a particular night."

The closest word in English to translate \"festa\" would be \"festival\" but this is inadequate to describe the type of celebration that exists in Catalonia. \"Festes\" are ritual like celebrations that have been passed down through generations of people for more than 700 years. They are organized by the people of a town for their own enjoyment, and not for any commercial interest. \"Festival\" (which also exists in the Catalan and Castilian languages) denotes an event that is usually organized by a specific group of people for a particular market, and is often motivated by economic interest.\n“Festes” have ritual like sequences of events that usually involve Giants, Devils, Human Castles and processions. A magical atmosphere is created at the “festa”, almost like a type of Catharsis. “Festes” stem from Medieval Times when fantastical dragons and Giants were created to instruct people about religion in church services. Shortly after the fantastical creatures became a part of the Corpus Christi processions that paraded through the town during the summer. The importance given to these folkloric elements has gradually increased over time and now they have assumed a national importance. Nowadays, these traditions are associated with Catalan identity as something that is individual and separate from the rest of Spain.\nThese “festes” are not greatly publicized by the Catalan government for visitors.\nBirdwatching\n[\nedit\n]\nBecause of its geographical location and terrific range of habitats, including dry steppes, rocky coastlines, mountains and some of the most important wetland sites in Europe, Catalonia has a greater variety of bird life than anywhere else on the peninsula, with 95% of Iberia's and 50% of the whole Palearctic's recorded bird species.\nSome of the most sought-after are the bearded vulture, black woodpecker, wallcreeper, Bonelli's eagle, lesser grey shrike, little bustard, pin-tailed sandgrouse, Audouin's gull and lesser crested tern. The most important sites are\nCap de Creus Natural Park\n,\nAiguamolls de l'Empordà Natural Park\n, Barcelona's Llobregat Delta, the\nParc del Garraf\n, Ebro Delta, the Steppes of Lleida and, of course, the Pyrenees.\nThere are a few companies that will organise tours for you, or even offer free advice, including Catalan Bird Tours and Oliva Rama Tours. There is also the Birdinginspain.com web site which offers birding sites and itineraries and lots of other useful information to help you plan your ornithological trip to Catalonia."

There are more than 300 licensed accommodation possibilities on Ibiza, that cover the entire budget range, from hostels to exclusive and intimate rural hotels, and most are represented with web pages online and in numerous travel guides, but do not go there in August without a reservation. You could wind up on the street or on the beach (also illegal).\nThere are also plenty of apartment and villa bookings for those looking at tailor made vacations, especially since the birth of sites, such as Airbnb and Holiday Lettings there has been a boom from property owners renting vacation rentals.

You can actually find everything you would expect in a holiday resort, from the well-known fast-food chains to stalls, from small to large restaurants. In addition to Spanish cuisine, Asian cuisine and Italian cuisine are particularly well represented here. The prices very often have a lot to do with the location. It is significantly more expensive in busy places than in the back streets. It is therefore worth taking a look around before choosing a restaurant. The quality also fluctuates very clearly, but the quality does not always have to have something to do with the price. Here, too, it is worth taking a look around first.\nSpanish cuisine also follows demand here. Almost every Spanish restaurant offers tapas platters, which then represent a whole meal. Paella is also always offered. Here, too, you have to be careful, because to save time, some of it comes from the freezer. You always have to wait about half an hour for a paella made on site. If you really want to have good Spanish food, then you should go into the hinterland. Here you are also prepared for holidaymakers, but the quality is usually better than in the middle of the seaside resorts.\nIf you really want to eat tapas, you shouldn't be satisfied with the tapas platters offered over and over again. In the bars off the beaten track of tourists, when ordering a beer, wine or even a soft drink, you get a tapa, as is traditional. Which one this is in the case remains a surprise. There are olives, Andalucian bread (toasted white bread with tomato, garlic and olive oil) or just toasted toast with olive oil. With every order you get something different. These are tapas based on the original tapas culture. Tasty and easy."

It is an ideal place for wineries to multiply, spread, consolidate and, in the process, amass large quantities of money for their owners. As these fortunes grow, new brands need to be created and fresh images must be marketed. One way some wineries achieve this is by using avant-garde architecture for the construction of their buildings.\nIn the little town of Elciego, the Marques de Riscal winery has one of these futuristic buildings designed by world-famous architect Frank Gehry (he also designed the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, a hundred miles or so to the north). This time, however, he \"pushed the envelope\" (so to speak) of the Guggenheim style. He made the Guggenheim convoluted shapes flow more freely as if a storm were blowing on the outer surfaces and making them flap like flags in the wind. The result is absolutely astonishing. The sole purpose for the edifice is to be a temple to Bacchus, the god of wine!\nA few miles away, just outside Laguardia, Santiago Calatrava, another famous architect, has created the Isios winery. (His work includes the modern Olympic stadium in Athens, Greece, and the ultra-modern City of Arts and Sciences/Performing Arts Centre, in Valencia, Spain.) Although not as much \"out-on-the-edge\" as the Marques de Riscal winery, its soaring, wavy roof set against the backdrop of the blue sky and the green mountain range is a sight to see.\nThe industrialist Solomon R. Guggenheim was inspired by Baroness Hilla Rebay von Ehrenwiesen's love for modern art. Rebay laid more emphasis on art that is non-objective. Guggenheim is known for his debates on abstract art with Robert Delaunay, Albert Gleizes, and Wassily Kandinsky. Kandinsky's Composition 8 was purchased by Guggenheim, which made the entire collection famous"

It never gets boring here. On the contrary, you are almost spoiled for choice as to what to do, because the possibilities are so diverse.\nBut first, a few general tips. In Spain nightlife starts relatively late. You first go to a bar or bodega and eat and drink something. You don't actually stay in a single bar, but wander from bar to bar, have a drink and move on. The clubs and discos open around midnight. Now you can throw yourself into the disco where you like the music best, but here, too, the general rule is that you don't stay in a disco or club, but rather move on. In the clubs and discos, women usually have free entry, while men often have to pay. The night ends at dawn and you meet again in a bar to have breakfast.\nBut even those who want to take it easy will always find a restaurant or bar on the Costa del Sol where you can sit and chat until late at night. And in fact there are also many very beautiful ones. You can often sit outside, often near a beach. You can hear the waves and let the wind blow around your head. In most bars you can always eat something. Usually they have very nice little things (tapas) to offer.\nThe busiest place is definitely in Malaga. In the old town there are tons of small bars and pubs, all of which invite you to linger and whoever wants to go dancing will always find something that suits their taste. If you have a little more money in your pocket, you can visit the exclusive clubs in Marbella. Here you can be lucky enough to come across a star or little star. There is also something going on every night in Torremolinos, Fuengirola and Benalmádena. Here you will find something for every taste and you can party all night."

The closest word in English to translate \"festa\" would be \"festival\" but this is inadequate to describe the type of celebration that exists in Catalonia. \"Festes\" are ritual like celebrations that have been passed down through generations of people for more than 700 years. They are organized by the people of a town for their own enjoyment, and not for any commercial interest. \"Festival\" (which also exists in the Catalan and Castilian languages) denotes an event that is usually organized by a specific group of people for a particular market, and is often motivated by economic interest.\n“Festes” have ritual like sequences of events that usually involve Giants, Devils, Human Castles and processions. A magical atmosphere is created at the “festa”, almost like a type of Catharsis. “Festes” stem from Medieval Times when fantastical dragons and Giants were created to instruct people about religion in church services. Shortly after the fantastical creatures became a part of the Corpus Christi processions that paraded through the town during the summer. The importance given to these folkloric elements has gradually increased over time and now they have assumed a national importance. Nowadays, these traditions are associated with Catalan identity as something that is individual and separate from the rest of Spain.\nThese “festes” are not greatly publicized by the Catalan government for visitors."

    "text": "Get around\n[\nedit\n]\nBy public transport\n[\nedit\n]\nThe public transport in the city and the surrounding area managed by\nAutoritat del Transport Metropolità\n(ATM) consortium who provide information about services by all operators. The whole area is covered by the\nIntegrated Fare System\n, which is divided into\n6 zones\n. This system includes the most of the public transport in the area: metro, city and intercity bus, tram and commuter trains. Like most major European cities Barcelona has moved to a rechargeable ticketing system called\nT-mobilitat.\n.\nThe city limits of Barcelona are completely inside zone 1. The public transport in the city is mostly operated by\nTransports Metropolitans de Barcelona\n(TMB). They have a separate site\ndedicated for tourists\n. Other operators in Barcelona are\nRodalies de Catalunya\n;\nFerrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya\n(FGC) &\nTram\n.\nBarcelona's Metro system and some railway lines.\nT-mobilitat\nis a card or smartphone app that is the carrier of many of the contactless pass types below and can allow you to travel throughout the Barcelona metropolitan area.\nThere are three physical types.\nPersonal reloadable plastic card costing\n€4.50 that has to be registered. It is mainly aimed at local residents but people staying for an extended period may find it useful as it supports all pass types. If lost, it is possible to block the card and recover the passes on the card.\nAnonymous reloadable cardboard cards\nwhich cost €0.50 and can only support one pass at a time. They can support T-casual, T-familier or T-grup passes. T-usual passes are also available on this type of card but can only be reloaded with T-usual passes. This is low cost option aimed at less frequent users like tourists.\nNFC Smartphone app\nhas a €1.00 registration fee. Supports all ticket types (but do you want to pull your phone out every time you want to validate a pass?)\nPasses & tickets available:\nSingle ticket\n.\nA\nnon-integrated\nticket is valid only for single mode of transport of a specific operator: either bus, metro or funicular, etc. On buses you can use a contactless bank card without a physical ticket for one journey.\n€2.65\n.\n(\nupdated Jan 2025\n)\nBillet aeroport\nNon-integrated ticket for use on the metro between any point on the metro system and the airport. There are other tickets that can be used on metro line 9 at the airport, see below. €5.70.\nHola BCN! cards\n.\nFor unlimited number of journeys for 2, 3, 4 or 5 days. They are valid for TMB metro and bus, tram, FGC and regional trains in the city and metropolitan area. You will find the T-casual and its sister passes better value. They are one of the passes valid on airport metro L9. not T-Mobilitat.\n2-day card €18.10\n.\n(\nupdated Jan 2025\n)\nIntegrated for a fixed number of journeys.\nUnfortunately these passes are not valid for travel to/from the airport by metro L9, but they are valid to/from the airport on the bus and train. All use\nT-mobilitat.\nT-casual. This pass is for a single-person for 10 single journeys. During each journey it's possible to make up to three transfers. The whole duration of a journey must be no more than 1hr 15min and within zone 1. The T-casual is the good option for tourists. It's more convenient than buying single tickets and better value than the single tickets for more than 4 trips. It's far cheaper than the various discount cards with free transportation option. And finally, it doesn't bind one to specific routes like the hop-on-hop-off buses. T-casual for Zone 1 €12.55.\nT-familier. Multi-person pass valid for 8 journeys, valid for 30 days. To correctly share this pass, the number of validations must match the number of people travelling together. T-familier for 1 zone €11.05\nT-grup. Multi-person pass for 70 journeys, valid for 30 days. To correctly share this pass, the number of validations must match the number of people travelling together.  T-grup for zone 1  €87.35\nIntegrated for an unlimited number of journeys for a number of days.\nThese passes are valid for travel from the Airport on the Metro L9.\nT-dia Single-person pass with an unlimited number of integrated journeys for 24 hours. Only one round trip to/from the airport on the metro L9 is allowed. T-dia for zone 1 €11.55. (not issued on T-mobilitat)\nT-usual Non-transferable single-person pass with an unlimited number of journeys on any means of transport within the integrated system, for 30 consecutive days as of the first use, for the number of zones purchased. You must enter your passport or identity card number when purchasing these passes and you must carry the identity document when using the pass. T-usual for zone 1 €22.00 (discounted price during 2025). If loaded onto a cardboard T-mobilitat card, only T-usual cards can be reloaded onto the card. This pass is not valid for travel to/from the airport on metro L9.\nThe discount on T-usual cards has been extended into 2025 so may be worth considering for longer stays.\nAn operator independent travel planner is available on the\nBarcelona Government website.\nThere is a tendency for operators to emphasise their own services on their maps.\nBy metro\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nMetro\n(subway) is an efficient way of getting around town. Operation times are 05:00–24:00 (M–Th), 05:00–02:00 (F), and continuous service from Saturday at 05:00 until Sunday at midnight. Stations are marked\non most maps; every station has a detailed map of exits to the city. Trains are fast, often coming in two minute intervals. However, on holidays and weekends trains only run every 6-8 minutes and can get easily packed. Announcements are made only in Catalan, though signs and ticketing machines generally include Spanish and English too.\nThe\nT-10 (1 zone)\nis the discontinued paper ticket. Partially replaced by T-casual\nPay attention to the fact that to get from metro lines operated by TMB (\nL1\n,\nL2\n,\nL3\n,\nL4\n,\nL5\n,\nL9\n/\nL10\nand\nL11\n) to the ones operated by FGC (\nL6\n,\nL7\nand\nL8\n), or vice versa, you need to exit and then enter through a new pay-gate. In this case, if you had a one-journey ticket, you need to get a new one. If you used a multiple journey ticket you won't be charged for a second time when changing lines as long as you are within the stated travel time for a single journey. Also, you can't repeat operator, so you can't use a FGC ride to make a shortcut. For instance: changing to L9S to L1 via L8 using Fira and Espanya will charge you with two journeys, you should go via Torrassa instead although its way longer. All trains are air-conditioned, but the metro stations themselves are not, so beware because the stations can become very hot during summer months.\nAlso be aware when travelling to/from the airport by Metro line L9 Sud: while the T-casual is valid for\nR2\nNORD\nRenfe services (or buses), it is not accepted for the\nMetro. If you use the Metro line L9 Sud to and from the airport using a T-casual ticket, you'll be forced to pay the full fare, which is €5.50, and the ticket you've used will not be refunded.\nBy tram\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are two main sets of tram lines, Trambaix\nT1\nT2\nT3\ntowards the North West of the city and Trambesòs\nT4\nT5\nT6\ntowards the East of the city near the coast. There are interchange points with other modes of transport. These lines are run by\nTram\nand all lines are in zone 1.\nThere is one other tramway run by TMB but is not part of the integrated ticketing system:\nTramvia Blau\n. This is a historic tram that connects to the Tibidabo Funecular. Unfortunately in 2024 it is closed for maintenance with bus 196 available as a replacement.\nBy train\n[\nedit\n]\nRegional suburban trains run through Barcelona and share ticketing with the modes of transport above. There are two operators: RENFE and FGC. Wrongly ignored by some tourists, they provide a useful additional mode of transport for getting across the city or connecting with mainline rail services and the airport.\nThe trains run by RENFE share tracks with mainline trains and are called Rodalies\n(known in the rest of Spain as Cercanías). They operate lines\nR1\nR2\nSUD\nR2\nR2\nNORD\nR3\nR4\nR7\nR8\n. NOTE that the integrated system\nmap\nshows fare zones that do not coincide with the integrated transport zones of different transportation companies but the integrated fare Zone 1 is shown with the addition of the airport T2 station on\nR2\nNORD\n. However, due to chronic underfunding severe disruptions are more the norm than the exception (as of March 2025, the service on line R3 had been completely suspended, without expectations of either restoration the same day or any replacement services), so seriously consider other alternatives before choosing RENFE-operated trains.\nThe trains run by\nFGC\nare\nS1\nS2\nS3\nS4\nS8\nS9\nand some are confusingly prefixed with an R\nR5\nR50\nR6\nR60\n. In addition FGC operates\nL6\nL7\nL8\nbut these are considered to be part of the Barcelona metro.\nWatch out, it is possible to travel beyond integrated fare Zone 1 on both systems. There is a good map on the\nFGC website\nshowing all rail lines and the boundary of Zone 1.\nBy bus\n[\nedit\n]\nAn articulated Barcelona city bus\nThe\nbus network\nin Barcelona is pretty extensive. Perhaps the best option in planning your route is to consult with one of the route planners mentioned above.\nA major reorganisation of bus lines was completed in November 2018, so disregard old bus schedules and recheck routes. For example, bus line 92 to Park Güell, used by many tourists to get there after a visit to the Sagrada Familia, has been suspended, and a new line V15 stops there but takes a different route through the city centre (Passeig de Sant Joan).\nHere are some tips for bus line codes:\nHxx lines run parallel to the coastline, low numbers run on the high side, high numbers on the sea side.\nVxx lines run from the beach to the hills, high numbers on the northern side (Besòs), low numbers on the southern (Llobregat).\nDxx lines run in a somewhat diagonal path, although interestingly none of these cover neither Diagonal or Meridiana avenues, the main oblique streets.\nMxx lines are found at the outer perimeter of metro coverage and link a metro stop to a neighbourhood lacking metro service.\nBxx lines run on the northern area outside Barcelona or linking Barcelona to neighbouring municipalities in the metropolitan area, B stands for Besòs river.\nLxx lines run on the southern area alike Bxx lines, L stands for Llobregat river.\nSome municipalities have lines fully inside the town limits with two letters and a digit, theses two letters are reminiscent of the town name, such as BDx for Badalona and LHx for L'Hospitalet\nNxx lines run only at night when all other lines do not run, roughly from 23:00 to 6:00.\nCxx lines link Barcelona the various northern coastal Maresme towns up to\nMataró\n.\nExx lines are express buses from Barcelona to various municipalities 10–60 km (6.2–37.3 mi) outside of the metropolitan area.\nLines with one or two digits without any letter follow historical routes from before the H-V-D schema.\nLines between 100 and 199 are usually very local lines served with low-capacity cars and poor frequency, 30 min or worse. Notable cases are line 111 to the Tibidabo amusement park, line 120 through Ciutat Vella, and line 150 to Olympic venues and the Montjuïc castle; others are mostly useless for tourists.\nLine numbers from 200 upwards are used for some routes going outside the metropolitan area, while some others of the same kind have no number at all.\nBuses H-V-D run about every 6–12 min weekdays, 15–20 min weekends.\nNitbus (N) run every 20 min all night.\nInformation is available from AMB\nAll Nitbuses (except N0 & N19) start or pass through Pl Catalunya\nTake note that some lines have special fare restrictions: Barcelona cards (unlimited travel for 2 to 5 days) are valid only on Hxx, Vxx, Dxx and line numbers below 200. Fare 1 travelcards are not valid for Cxx, Exx and line numbers above 200 – actually, trips fully inside fare zone 1 are not permitted on these lines no matter what ticket is used. If you board any of these buses inside fare zone 1 you won't be able to get off until reaching another fare zone.\nBarcelona Bus Turístic\n.\nThis bus has three routes (map provided as you board), including a northbound and a southbound line that leave from opposite sides of the\nPlaça de Catalunya\n. Each takes 1–2 hours. The hop-on/hop-off format lets you get-off at any interesting stop, see what interests you, then get back on any later bus at that or any other stop. One approach is stay on for an entire route, then continue while getting off at locations that interested you earlier. Buses are double-decked, with the open-air upper deck offering much better views – but sunscreen is essential in summer months, jackets in winter, early spring and late autumn. Earphones are offered when you first get on so you can hear the commentary as you drive by significant locations. Outlets near every seat let you choose among many languages and playback volumes. The buses are very frequent. For a cheaper option with more flexibility in routes opt for the metro and the T-casual.\nAdult prices: 1 day ticket €33, 2 days €44; tickets can be bought at the bus stops, some hotels, etc. or\nonline with 10% discount\n.\n(\nupdated Mar 2024\n)\nBy scooter\n[\nedit\n]\nExcept for deliveries, electric scooters are forbidden on sidewalks and all pedestrian walks throughout Barcelona. Doing so may subject one to hefty fines, as well as frequent, audible disdain from pedestrians. Electric scooters are permitted in bicycle lanes, and may share the road with automobiles.\nMattia46\nscooters for rent: 50cc to 200cc.\nGoCar\nis a two-seater, 3 wheeled vehicle that runs with a 49cc engine. It is legally classified as a scooter to drive on the roads. The GoCars were created with the purpose of being rented to tourists as a different way to see a city.\nCooltra Motos\nScooter rental. You can rent a moped for 1 day up to 1 month. You can also take a part in private or group tours.\nBookYourMoto\nScooter and motorcycle rental in Barcelona. Cheap motorbike hire in Barcelona.\nBy bicycle\n[\nedit\n]\nBarcelona also has its own shared bike system, called BiCiNg. However, this is only accessible to locals. Mainly in the Western parts of the city, these are replaced by\nAmbici\nbikes - while non-residents can sign up, the conditions are not overly attractive (significant annual fee and rental prices encourage short-time rentals).\nDonkey Republic\n. The orange bikes of Donkey Republic are placed all around the city. Tourists can rent and unlock the bikes via the company's app 24 hours a day, which can lock and unlock the bike by Bluetooth. Bikes start at €12 per day.\nBolt\noffers app-based ebike rentals, however the number of bikes is limited.\nRidemovie\noffers app-based rentals.\nPerry Tours - Bike Tours Barcelona\nPerry Tours offers daily guided bike tours in Barcelona with English and Dutch guides, providing a fun and unique way to explore the city's highlights and experience its lively atmosphere. Located at Plaça de George Orwell, 08002 Barcelona  –  Business hours:  Monday till Sunday: 10:00 – 18:00h. –  Phone: +34 603 32 65 88\nTres Gatos Bike Tours\noffers unique guided bike tours in Barcelona, including exclusive routes to Montjuic and Tibidabo.

For detailed schedules and booking, visit their website.\nBy segway\n[\nedit\n]\nBarcelona Segway Day\n,\nRull 2 08002\n,\n☏\n+34 608 408 112\n.\nVisit Barrio Gotic and Barceloneta.\nfrom €29\n.\n(\nupdated May 2015\n)\nOn foot\n[\nedit\n]\nBarcelona is a very walkable city. It takes little over an hour to walk from Port Vell at the seaside to Park Güell at the foothills of the mountain range at the northeastern end of the city, and you can see a range of attractions, including La Rambla and Sagrada Família, on your way. There are opportunities all around to sit down and enjoy a drink or a meal everywhere. If you are fit, you can pretty much explore the city by foot alone, unless the heat beats you in the warmer months (and then you can always resort to the air-conditioned metro).\nBy car\n[\nedit\n]\nParking around all major tourist destinations is expensive (€3/hour, €20-36/day) and the spaces are difficult to navigate, as there are several classes of public parking spaces, with complicated rules for each class. Barcelona is plagued with the same problems that plague other major European cities; massive traffic jams and extremely narrow streets in some areas, coupled with a very complicated road system. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended for tourists, especially those with no driving experience in large cities. Public transport will get you to all the major areas, and you should use that as your main mode of transport.\nHaving a driving map is essential - plan your route before you set off. Navigating with an average tourist map is frequently misleading: many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable). As an example,\nGran via de Les Corts Catalanes\nis actually a one-way northbound street between Espanya and Marina, the opposite direction is reserved for buses and taxis only.\nSome free parking spots reported by travelers are:\nNear\nMoll de Sant Bertran\n(which is south-west from\nMuseu Maritim\n) - driving at B–10, exit to WTC and make a complete round at roundabout, heading to warehouses - and park next to its employees cars.\nSomewhere near Guell Park.\nNear Font Màgica, in Plaça Espanya and the Montjuïc hill.\nGetting around by car makes sense if you plan to spend much more time driving outside the city borders than inside it - and ideally if you don't plan to park overnight at all. Otherwise, for purely in-city transportation, consider renting a scooter, or using public transportation instead.\nBy taxi\n[\nedit\n]\nAs of January 2019,\nride-sharing services\nsuch as Uber require at least one hour's notice. For less than one hour's notice, you need to call a regular taxi."

    "text": "Alava\n[\nedit\n]\nDolmen in the midst of vineyards near Elvillar\nAlava, along with its neighbor La Rioja, on the other bank of the Ebro River, produces world-class wines and is especially famous for its robust reds.\nSituated in the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains, Alava offers an easy rolling landscape, mild climate and vineyards everywhere. It is an ideal place for wineries to multiply, spread, consolidate and, in the process, amass large quantities of money for their owners. As these fortunes grow, new brands need to be created and fresh images must be marketed. One way some wineries achieve this is by using avant-garde architecture for the construction of their buildings.\nIn the little town of Elciego, the Marques de Riscal winery has one of these futuristic buildings designed by world-famous architect Frank Gehry (he also designed the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, a hundred miles or so to the north). This time, however, he \"pushed the envelope\" (so to speak) of the Guggenheim style. He made the Guggenheim convoluted shapes flow more freely as if a storm were blowing on the outer surfaces and making them flap like flags in the wind. The result is absolutely astonishing. The sole purpose for the edifice is to be a temple to Bacchus, the god of wine!\nA few miles away, just outside Laguardia, Santiago Calatrava, another famous architect, has created the Isios winery. (His work includes the modern Olympic stadium in Athens, Greece, and the ultra-modern City of Arts and Sciences/Performing Arts Centre, in Valencia, Spain.) Although not as much \"out-on-the-edge\" as the Marques de Riscal winery, its soaring, wavy roof set against the backdrop of the blue sky and the green mountain range is a sight to see.\nThe industrialist Solomon R. Guggenheim was inspired by Baroness Hilla Rebay von Ehrenwiesen's love for modern art. Rebay laid more emphasis on art that is non-objective. Guggenheim is known for his debates on abstract art with Robert Delaunay, Albert Gleizes, and Wassily Kandinsky. Kandinsky's Composition 8 was purchased by Guggenheim, which made the entire collection famous"

Nearly all of the most famous tourist areas are in the centre of the city including Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Palacio Real, and Plaza de Colón. The major streets in Madrid include the Gran Via, Alcalá Street, and Paseo de la Castellana.\nClimate\n[\nedit\n]\nThe climate of Madrid is continental, mainly dry and quite extreme at times. Madrid experiences a characteristically hot and dry summer, along with a fairly cold winter with frequent frosts during the night and occasional snowfalls. Spring and autumn are generally mild with the most rainfall concentrated in these seasons. Spring and autumn are definitely the best times to visit, especially the months of April, May, June, September and October. There is very little rainfall during summer and also less rainfall during winter. During winter, snow occurs sporadically; however, snow usually lasts only for a few days, but there is abundant snowfall in the adjacent mountain ranges nearby.\nPlaza Mayor\nMadrid\nClimate chart (\nexplanation\n)\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\n33\n10\n3\n35\n12\n4\n25\n16\n6\n45\n18\n8\n51\n22\n11\n21\n28\n16\n12\n32\n19\n10\n31\n19\n22\n26\n15\n60\n19\n11\n58\n14\n6\n51\n10\n4\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °C\nPrecipitation\n+\nSnow\ntotals in mm\nImperial conversion\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\n1.3\n50\n37\n1.4\n54\n39\n1\n61\n43\n1.8\n65\n46\n2\n72\n52\n0.8\n83\n61\n0.5\n90\n66\n0.4\n88\n66\n0.9\n80\n60\n2.4\n67\n51\n2.3\n56\n43\n2\n50\n38\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °F\nPrecipitation\n+\nSnow\ntotals in inches\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nTemple of Debod with Torre de Madrid and Edificio Espana in the background\nMadrid is a city that goes back to the Spanish Muslims, but virtually nothing of Madrid before the Reconquista is left. A few historic city walls have been archeologically preserved but Madrid was by far overshadowed by\nToledo\n(Roman\nToletum\n) until the early modern era. To give just one example, construction on Madrid Cathedral did not start until the late 19th century, and only finished in the 1990s, as the archbishop of Toledo did not want to relinquish episcopal power, and the monarchs had moved the capital in part precisely to escape the power of Toledo's archbishop.\nThe culture of Madrid was dominated by its royal history, centre of the Spanish Empire. The Royal Palace, big plazas and buildings used by the Spanish Monarchy, enormous cathedrals and churches are plentiful in Madrid. Madrid is now just as much a cosmopolitan city as\nBerlin\nor\nLondon\n: full of modern architecture, lifestyle and culture.\nMadrid became capital of\nSpain\nunder Philip II who had a gargantuan palace built in nearby\nEl Escorial\n. For a long while, Madrid would be the royal residence first, only becoming a city much later. Madrid architecture often reflects the era in which it was built. The Spanish Habsburgs (\"Los Austrias\") who reigned until the death of unfortunate Charles II in 1700 predominantly used red brick for facades and black schist for the roofs. The later Bourbon dynasty (ruling today after the two Republican interludes) preferred granite to brick, giving their buildings a greyer tone. The king that had the largest influence on Madrid after Philip II was perhaps Charles III. He was nicknamed \"el Rey Alcalde\" (the mayor-king) or \"Madrid's best mayor\" due to his extensive building and modernisation programmes in the city. Other royal projects that left their mark are Isabel II's freshwater canal, and the metro which was started in 1919 with King Alfonso XIII's own money. However, both those monarchs were so unpopular that they were later overthrown by their own people, giving rise to the First and Second Spanish Republics.\nBeing the capital of Spain, Madrid came to be associated - justly or not, for better and for worse - with the governing trends in Spain by Spaniards in other parts of the country. As the governing trends swung widely from anti-clerical Republic to hyper-catholic fascist Franco dictatorship, this has influenced the perception of Madrid in the rest of Spain. During the 2nd Republic (1931-1936), it was a bustling city of new ideas with many political issues of the day literally fought out on the streets of Madrid. During the Civil War, Madrid endured a three year siege (1936-1939) by the anti-Republican troops and was one of the last places to hold out for the Republic. During the dictatorship of Francisco Franco (1939-1975), the city represented the heart of the repressive hyper-conservative dictatorship to many Spaniards, particularly Basques and Catalans. However, the city is also the epicentre of the famous Movida of the 1980s, a Spanish movement that bred personalities such as the director Pedro Almodóvar. The heritage of this era is indeed still visible in the city centre, where a party can be found at all times and one of the most liberal and colourful environments of Spain can be seen. The city is also known for its acceptance of LGBT people.\nModern politics\n[\nedit\n]\nSince Franco's death, Madrid's city politics have swung widely from right to left and back, at first having a (socialist) PSOE-led government through the 1980s which was replaced by the centre-right PP which dominated the city through an awkward mix of paternalistic public works, free-for-all housing plans, and other anarchic construction projects in the 1990s. The 2000s saw a more nuanced approach by Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón, also of the PP, who focused on upgrading Madrid's ring road (the M30), expanding the metro system, and liberalising the economy. The 2008 financial crisis hit Madrid hard, which gave rise to ex-communist Manuela Carmena in the 2010s. Despite showing early promises, Carmena's popularity dwindled, and the PP's José Luis Martínez-Almeida ousted her as mayor by winning the 2019 elections forming a governing coalition with two new political parties: the centrist Ciudadanos and the far-right Vox. This rightwards shift reinforced itself with the popularity of Isabel Diaz Ayuso, the PP president of the Community of Madrid.\nMadrileño everyday life\n[\nedit\n]\nNightlife in\nPuerta del Sol\nThe citizens of Madrid refer to themselves as\nMadrileños\nor the more traditional and now seldom-used term \"gatos\" (cats). They live by a daily routine that is heavily influenced by the climate. Due to the typically midday heat during summer, a \"siesta\" can be still observed during which some citizens take a break to cool off, though\nMadrileños\ncan usually only afford this 'luxury' during holidays and weekends.\nMost stores are open throughout the day; just small stores are often closed during siesta. Workers and those more afflicted by Western lifestyles choose not to observe this long break and work usually between 09:00 and 18:00-19:00. However, during summer, many offices have a summer schedule requiring workers to start at 08:00 and finish at 15:00 (most commonly without the standard 1-2 hour break for lunch).\nOffices usually close over the weekend but businesses are often open Saturday morning, or until the afternoon in the city centre. Most grocers are closed on Sundays, but some major chain and department stores linked to \"culture\" (books, music, etc.) will be open every day. Shops and department stores in Puerta del Sol area are open every day.\nMadrid has a very modern and elaborate transportation network of buses and Metro with a few \"Light Metro\" tram lines in the outskirts. The city contrasts with some large European cities in that it is extremely clean, and city employees in bright yellow vests can almost always be seen cleaning the streets and sidewalks. Like most large cities, however, there is a substantial population of vagrants and beggars lining the streets.\nMadrid is one of the biggest and most cosmopolitan cities in Europe. Communities of West Africans, North Africans, other Europeans (especially Romanians), Chinese, Filipinos, Pakistanis, and above all Latin Americans are prominent.\nNightlife\n[\nedit\n]\nMadrid possibly has the most bars per capita of any European city and a very active nightlife; Madrileños are known to stay up until as late as 05:00-07:00. It is quite common to see a crowded Gran Vía on weekend nights. Due to this lifestyle, lodging near the fun areas may end up a nightmare for light sleepers if your window faces the street.\nTourist information\n[\nedit\n]\nTourism website\nof the city of Madrid."

Although this effect is unproven in its pure form, the Guggenheim nevertheless changed the world wide perception of Bilbao. The graceful, sensuous curves, evocative of the ships that used to be ubiquitous along the docks of Bilbao, are covered in titanium squares, which resemble the scales of a fish and shimmer in the sunlight. In keeping with the maritime theme, appropriate for the setting, the skylights of the largest gallery (formerly known as the Fish gallery) are designed to look like the fins of fish. Many parts of the building are purely decorative, and don't serve any purpose. The permanent collection is not particularly impressive, but the museum always hosts at least one interesting temporary exhibit, frequently comprised of masterpieces from the other Guggenheim collections.\nAdults €16.00; +65, students, -26: €8; -18 free (online prices, door prices €1-2 higher)\n.\n(\nupdated Jul 2023\n)\n43.267692\n-2.934489\n2\nPuppy\n.\nNot a museum, but it is directly in the front of the Guggenheim Museum, created by Jeff Koons.

    "text": "Understand\n[\nedit\n]\nView from Old Melilla\nMelilla has a rich and fascinating history that dates back centuries. Founded by the Phoenicians in the 8th century BC, the city was part of the Carthaginian Empire before being conquered by the Romans, as was much of North Africa. Later, Melilla became part of Visigothic Hispania.\nIn 1497, during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, the city was incorporated into the Crown of Castile. In 1773, the Moroccan Sultan Mohammed III attempted to seize the Christian-held territories in North Africa, but Spain managed to retain control of Melilla thanks to British intervention. Following the Rif War and the establishment of the Spanish protectorate, the city experienced significant economic growth. Melilla became the economic capital of the eastern region of the protectorate, driven by the exploitation of the Rif mines and the expansion of industry, trade, and fishing.\nOne of Melilla's most remarkable features is its pluralistic coexistence. The city is home to Christians, Muslims, Jews, and Hindus, all sharing an environment of peace and mutual respect.

    "text": "Get around\n[\nedit\n]\nRENFE runs trains in and out of Galicia's major cities and many smaller ones. The RENFE website provides all travel times, and tickets can be purchased online. There may not be many trains each day, but the speed of travel improved in the 2010s. For internal trips in Galicia, the A Coruña-Vigo line (north to south along the Atlantic coast) is the fastest and most efficient. The new high speed link (AVANT) connecting Ourense, Santiago and A Coruña has been partially completed. Cercanias's narrow gauge line covers the north coast from Ferrol to the border with Asturias.\nThere are bus companies that will take you to virtually anywhere in Galicia, and indeed in and out of Galicia. You will have to get yourself acquainted with these at the local bus station (there is one in each city and town), as there is a large number of possible routes and combinations. To the uninitiated, this can be confusing in the beginning.\nRenting a car is always a good option. Since it is not that common in Galicia, this keeps the price of renting relatively low. Diesel fuel is cheaper than gasoline, and the few toll roads can be relatively expensive but avoidable if traveling short distances. Roads are generally in good condition, though small mountain towns may have narrow, unmarked roads. Motorway driving might be fast but not vicious.  Radar ticketing machines are common along motorways but are signaled in advance. Indications in rural areas may be scarce, and the Galician settlement pattern and method to name places can be confusing. A GPS will help to solve all these problems."

    "text": "Stay safe\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the Spanish crime statistics, the Costa del Sol is very far ahead. Three cities with Malaga, Fuengirola and Torremolinos are in the top ten. Of course, there are also all sorts of crimes that have nothing to do with tourism, but street crime had assumed threatening proportions. Even in Marbella there was open street selling of drugs and open prostitution. In fact, they did something because they didn't want to drive away all of the holidaymakers. First of all, the police present tense has been greatly increased. If you go for a walk on the Costa del Sol, you will always come across a duo of police officers who are on patrol. And patrol vehicles are also part of the street scene.\nWell, holiday resorts, generally places where many people stay, belong to a worthwhile area for all kinds of theft and fraud, and this is not only the case on the Costa del Sol, it is the same everywhere there are many holidaymakers. So you always have to take care of your things. The normal advice applies that you should heed on every vacation, no matter where you are going. You should only take as much money with you as you really need, valuables are best left in the hotel safe, neck pouches are not nice but safer. Avoid street vendors and beggars and avoid crowds. Nothing new, not even on the Costa del Sol. If you observe these precautionary measures, you can get through your holiday well on the Coste del Sol, even if the number of cases here seems very high.\nThe human trafficking from Africa to Europe flourishes here on the Costa del Sol and kills many people every year. The route of marijuana from Morocco, one of the largest cultivation areas of this drug in the world, to Central Europe also leads over the Costa del Sol, no wonder, it is not far and there is a lot of shipping traffic. Then there is the rapidly growing unemployment. Corruption is still very widespread on the Costa del Sol.\nTo make matters worse, the police in Spain are organised very opaquely. In a small town you often see three different police authorities patrolling and you really don't know what one or the other is doing. But, as already mentioned, they are trying to increase the police presence and that has certainly been very successful."

    "text": "By public transport\n[\nedit\n]\nThe public transport in the city and the surrounding area managed by\nAutoritat del Transport Metropolità\n(ATM) consortium who provide information about services by all operators. The whole area is covered by the\nIntegrated Fare System\n, which is divided into\n6 zones\n. This system includes the most of the public transport in the area: metro, city and intercity bus, tram and commuter trains. Like most major European cities Barcelona has moved to a rechargeable ticketing system called\nT-mobilitat.\n.\nThe city limits of Barcelona are completely inside zone 1. The public transport in the city is mostly operated by\nTransports Metropolitans de Barcelona\n(TMB). They have a separate site\ndedicated for tourists\n. Other operators in Barcelona are\nRodalies de Catalunya\n;\nFerrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya\n(FGC) &\nTram\n.\nBarcelona's Metro system and some railway lines.\nT-mobilitat\nis a card or smartphone app that is the carrier of many of the contactless pass types below and can allow you to travel throughout the Barcelona metropolitan area.\nThere are three physical types.\nPersonal reloadable plastic card costing\n€4.50 that has to be registered. It is mainly aimed at local residents but people staying for an extended period may find it useful as it supports all pass types. If lost, it is possible to block the card and recover the passes on the card.\nAnonymous reloadable cardboard cards\nwhich cost €0.50 and can only support one pass at a time. They can support T-casual, T-familier or T-grup passes. T-usual passes are also available on this type of card but can only be reloaded with T-usual passes. This is low cost option aimed at less frequent users like tourists.\nNFC Smartphone app\nhas a €1.00 registration fee. Supports all ticket types (but do you want to pull your phone out every time you want to validate a pass?)\nPasses & tickets available:\nSingle ticket\n.\nA\nnon-integrated\nticket is valid only for single mode of transport of a specific operator: either bus, metro or funicular, etc. On buses you can use a contactless bank card without a physical ticket for one journey.\n€2.65\n.\n(\nupdated Jan 2025\n)\nBillet aeroport\nNon-integrated ticket for use on the metro between any point on the metro system and the airport.

The whole duration of a journey must be no more than 1hr 15min and within zone 1. The T-casual is the good option for tourists. It's more convenient than buying single tickets and better value than the single tickets for more than 4 trips. It's far cheaper than the various discount cards with free transportation option. And finally, it doesn't bind one to specific routes like the hop-on-hop-off buses. T-casual for Zone 1 €12.55.\nT-familier. Multi-person pass valid for 8 journeys, valid for 30 days. To correctly share this pass, the number of validations must match the number of people travelling together. T-familier for 1 zone €11.05\nT-grup.

T-usual for zone 1 €22.00 (discounted price during 2025). If loaded onto a cardboard T-mobilitat card, only T-usual cards can be reloaded onto the card. This pass is not valid for travel to/from the airport on metro L9.\nThe discount on T-usual cards has been extended into 2025 so may be worth considering for longer stays.\nAn operator independent travel planner is available on the\nBarcelona Government website.\nThere is a tendency for operators to emphasise their own services on their maps.\nBy metro\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nMetro\n(subway) is an efficient way of getting around town. Operation times are 05:00–24:00 (M–Th), 05:00–02:00 (F), and continuous service from Saturday at 05:00 until Sunday at midnight. Stations are marked\non most maps; every station has a detailed map of exits to the city. Trains are fast, often coming in two minute intervals. However, on holidays and weekends trains only run every 6-8 minutes and can get easily packed. Announcements are made only in Catalan, though signs and ticketing machines generally include Spanish and English too.\nThe\nT-10 (1 zone)\nis the discontinued paper ticket. Partially replaced by T-casual\nPay attention to the fact that to get from metro lines operated by TMB (\nL1\n,\nL2\n,\nL3\n,\nL4\n,\nL5\n,\nL9\n/\nL10\nand\nL11\n) to the ones operated by FGC (\nL6\n,\nL7\nand\nL8\n), or vice versa, you need to exit and then enter through a new pay-gate. In this case, if you had a one-journey ticket, you need to get a new one. If you used a multiple journey ticket you won't be charged for a second time when changing lines as long as you are within the stated travel time for a single journey. Also, you can't repeat operator, so you can't use a FGC ride to make a shortcut. For instance: changing to L9S to L1 via L8 using Fira and Espanya will charge you with two journeys, you should go via Torrassa instead although its way longer. All trains are air-conditioned, but the metro stations themselves are not, so beware because the stations can become very hot during summer months.\nAlso be aware when travelling to/from the airport by Metro line L9 Sud: while the T-casual is valid for\nR2\nNORD\nRenfe services (or buses), it is not accepted for the\nMetro. If you use the Metro line L9 Sud to and from the airport using a T-casual ticket, you'll be forced to pay the full fare, which is €5.50, and the ticket you've used will not be refunded.\nBy tram\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are two main sets of tram lines, Trambaix\nT1\nT2\nT3\ntowards the North West of the city and Trambesòs\nT4\nT5\nT6\ntowards the East of the city near the coast. There are interchange points with other modes of transport. These lines are run by\nTram\nand all lines are in zone 1.\nThere is one other tramway run by TMB but is not part of the integrated ticketing system:\nTramvia Blau\n. This is a historic tram that connects to the Tibidabo Funecular. Unfortunately in 2024 it is closed for maintenance with bus 196 available as a replacement.\nBy train\n[\nedit\n]\nRegional suburban trains run through Barcelona and share ticketing with the modes of transport above. There are two operators: RENFE and FGC. Wrongly ignored by some tourists, they provide a useful additional mode of transport for getting across the city or connecting with mainline rail services and the airport.\nThe trains run by RENFE share tracks with mainline trains and are called Rodalies\n(known in the rest of Spain as Cercanías). They operate lines\nR1\nR2\nSUD\nR2\nR2\nNORD\nR3\nR4\nR7\nR8\n. NOTE that the integrated system\nmap\nshows fare zones that do not coincide with the integrated transport zones of different transportation companies but the integrated fare Zone 1 is shown with the addition of the airport T2 station on\nR2\nNORD\n. However, due to chronic underfunding severe disruptions are more the norm than the exception (as of March 2025, the service on line R3 had been completely suspended, without expectations of either restoration the same day or any replacement services), so seriously consider other alternatives before choosing RENFE-operated trains.\nThe trains run by\nFGC\nare\nS1\nS2\nS3\nS4\nS8\nS9\nand some are confusingly prefixed with an R\nR5\nR50\nR6\nR60\n. In addition FGC operates\nL6\nL7\nL8\nbut these are considered to be part of the Barcelona metro.\nWatch out, it is possible to travel beyond integrated fare Zone 1 on both systems. There is a good map on the\nFGC website\nshowing all rail lines and the boundary of Zone 1.\nBy bus\n[\nedit\n]\nAn articulated Barcelona city bus\nThe\nbus network\nin Barcelona is pretty extensive. Perhaps the best option in planning your route is to consult with one of the route planners mentioned above.\nA major reorganisation of bus lines was completed in November 2018, so disregard old bus schedules and recheck routes. For example, bus line 92 to Park Güell, used by many tourists to get there after a visit to the Sagrada Familia, has been suspended, and a new line V15 stops there but takes a different route through the city centre (Passeig de Sant Joan).\nHere are some tips for bus line codes:\nHxx lines run parallel to the coastline, low numbers run on the high side, high numbers on the sea side.\nVxx lines run from the beach to the hills, high numbers on the northern side (Besòs), low numbers on the southern (Llobregat).\nDxx lines run in a somewhat diagonal path, although interestingly none of these cover neither Diagonal or Meridiana avenues, the main oblique streets.\nMxx lines are found at the outer perimeter of metro coverage and link a metro stop to a neighbourhood lacking metro service.\nBxx lines run on the northern area outside Barcelona or linking Barcelona to neighbouring municipalities in the metropolitan area, B stands for Besòs river.\nLxx lines run on the southern area alike Bxx lines, L stands for Llobregat river.\nSome municipalities have lines fully inside the town limits with two letters and a digit, theses two letters are reminiscent of the town name, such as BDx for Badalona and LHx for L'Hospitalet\nNxx lines run only at night when all other lines do not run, roughly from 23:00 to 6:00.\nCxx lines link Barcelona the various northern coastal Maresme towns up to\nMataró\n.\nExx lines are express buses from Barcelona to various municipalities 10–60 km (6.2–37.3 mi) outside of the metropolitan area.\nLines with one or two digits without any letter follow historical routes from before the H-V-D schema.\nLines between 100 and 199 are usually very local lines served with low-capacity cars and poor frequency, 30 min or worse. Notable cases are line 111 to the Tibidabo amusement park, line 120 through Ciutat Vella, and line 150 to Olympic venues and the Montjuïc castle; others are mostly useless for tourists.\nLine numbers from 200 upwards are used for some routes going outside the metropolitan area, while some others of the same kind have no number at all.\nBuses H-V-D run about every 6–12 min weekdays, 15–20 min weekends.\nNitbus (N) run every 20 min all night.\nInformation is available from AMB\nAll Nitbuses (except N0 & N19) start or pass through Pl Catalunya\nTake note that some lines have special fare restrictions: Barcelona cards (unlimited travel for 2 to 5 days) are valid only on Hxx, Vxx, Dxx and line numbers below 200. Fare 1 travelcards are not valid for Cxx, Exx and line numbers above 200 – actually, trips fully inside fare zone 1 are not permitted on these lines no matter what ticket is used. If you board any of these buses inside fare zone 1 you won't be able to get off until reaching another fare zone.\nBarcelona Bus Turístic\n.\nThis bus has three routes (map provided as you board), including a northbound and a southbound line that leave from opposite sides of the\nPlaça de Catalunya\n. Each takes 1–2 hours. The hop-on/hop-off format lets you get-off at any interesting stop, see what interests you, then get back on any later bus at that or any other stop. One approach is stay on for an entire route, then continue while getting off at locations that interested you earlier. Buses are double-decked, with the open-air upper deck offering much better views – but sunscreen is essential in summer months, jackets in winter, early spring and late autumn. Earphones are offered when you first get on so you can hear the commentary as you drive by significant locations. Outlets near every seat let you choose among many languages and playback volumes. The buses are very frequent. For a cheaper option with more flexibility in routes opt for the metro and the T-casual.\nAdult prices: 1 day ticket €33, 2 days €44; tickets can be bought at the bus stops, some hotels, etc. or\nonline with 10% discount\n.\n(\nupdated Mar 2024\n)"

Many people in Spain are surprised when discover the Catalan way to prepare \"pa amb tomàquet\", because instead of being sliced tomato with bread, the tomato (sometimes with garlic) is squashed and spread in the bread slice, dressed with extra virgin olive oil and small cuts of a very Catalan specialty: cured pork meat, that is, the famous Iberian ham (Spanish\njamón\n, Catalan\npernil\n), fuet, chorizo (\nxoriço\n), botifarra (spicy cured sausages), sobrassada, or other stuff like cheese or larger pieces of cooked meat. \"Pa amb tomàquet\" is a very deeply rooted meal in Catalan houses.\nPaella\n- Typical rice dish from the Catalan Lands. Catalan paella is with seafood, while Valencian paella is without seafood. There's also a variant of paella which is made up with little noodles called \"fideuà\". In addition, paella and fideuà can be prepared with black squid ink, then it's called \"fideuà negra\" or \"arròs negre\" (black fideuà and black rice respectively).\nBotifarra amb Mongetes\n- grilled sausage with beans.

This is usually a group meal, but is also available for couples or families.\nEscudella i carn d'olla\nis a traditional meat and vegetable stew or soup. It is characterised by the use of a pilota, a very big meatball seasoned with garlic and parsley; it also contains vegetables such as celery, cabbage or carrots, depending on the season.\nEscudella\nis typically served in two parts: the escudella proper is a soup consisting of a broth with pasta, rice or both. The\ncarn d'olla\nis all the meat used in the broth, served afterwards in a tray along with the vegetables used. When both parts are served mixed together, it is called\nescudella barred\n. A version of this soup called\nescudella de Nadal\n(Christmas soup) or\nsopa de galets\nand is very popular on Christmas Day.\nCaragols a la llauna\nis a simple dish of snails either grilled, or oven-roasted in a\nllauna\n(tin pan). They are served with aioli or vinaigrette. The dish is particularly favoured in\nLleida\n, where it has been promoted since 1980 by the Aplec del Caragol de Lleida.\nTrinxat\nis a food from the Pyrenees, principally Andorra and the Catalan comarques of Cerdanya and Alt Urgell.

Each year, in February or March, major cities in each region began the festivities. There are similarities and differences in each region's celebrations. People from the different villages surrounding the city come together to eat the freshly cured jamon from the recent matanzas. There is often a procession through the cities. Representatives from each of the area villages will follow each other down the streets, playing a percussion rhythm that identifies their town.  Children and adults dress in costume for this event. The kind of costume, and the behavior of the character, varies from region to region. These characters usually dance through the crowd hauntingly, trying to scare the bystanders. The characters include the Cigarróns, Pantallas, Peliqueiros, Xenerais, and Correos. The Xenerais are known for their singing, and often go door to door. The Peliqueiros carry whips and are recognizable for their large and ornate masks, representing different animals such as a cow, donkey, or rooster.

Although this effect is unproven in its pure form, the Guggenheim nevertheless changed the world wide perception of Bilbao. The graceful, sensuous curves, evocative of the ships that used to be ubiquitous along the docks of Bilbao, are covered in titanium squares, which resemble the scales of a fish and shimmer in the sunlight. In keeping with the maritime theme, appropriate for the setting, the skylights of the largest gallery (formerly known as the Fish gallery) are designed to look like the fins of fish.

Spring and autumn are definitely the best times to visit, especially the months of April, May, June, September and October. There is very little rainfall during summer and also less rainfall during winter. During winter, snow occurs sporadically; however, snow usually lasts only for a few days, but there is abundant snowfall in the adjacent mountain ranges nearby.\nPlaza Mayor\nMadrid\nClimate chart (\nexplanation\n)\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\n33\n10\n3\n35\n12\n4\n25\n16\n6\n45\n18\n8\n51\n22\n11\n21\n28\n16\n12\n32\n19\n10\n31\n19\n22\n26\n15\n60\n19\n11\n58\n14\n6\n51\n10\n4\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °C\nPrecipitation\n+\nSnow\ntotals in mm\nImperial conversion\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\n1.3\n50\n37\n1.4\n54\n39\n1\n61\n43\n1.8\n65\n46\n2\n72\n52\n0.8\n83\n61\n0.5\n90\n66\n0.4\n88\n66\n0.9\n80\n60\n2.4\n67\n51\n2.3\n56\n43\n2\n50\n38\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °F\nPrecipitation\n+\nSnow\ntotals in inches"

    "text": "By metro\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nMetro\n(subway) is an efficient way of getting around town. Operation times are 05:00–24:00 (M–Th), 05:00–02:00 (F), and continuous service from Saturday at 05:00 until Sunday at midnight. Stations are marked\non most maps; every station has a detailed map of exits to the city. Trains are fast, often coming in two minute intervals. However, on holidays and weekends trains only run every 6-8 minutes and can get easily packed. Announcements are made only in Catalan, though signs and ticketing machines generally include Spanish and English too.\nThe\nT-10 (1 zone)\nis the discontinued paper ticket. Partially replaced by T-casual\nPay attention to the fact that to get from metro lines operated by TMB (\nL1\n,\nL2\n,\nL3\n,\nL4\n,\nL5\n,\nL9\n/\nL10\nand\nL11\n) to the ones operated by FGC (\nL6\n,\nL7\nand\nL8\n), or vice versa, you need to exit and then enter through a new pay-gate. In this case, if you had a one-journey ticket, you need to get a new one. If you used a multiple journey ticket you won't be charged for a second time when changing lines as long as you are within the stated travel time for a single journey. Also, you can't repeat operator, so you can't use a FGC ride to make a shortcut. For instance: changing to L9S to L1 via L8 using Fira and Espanya will charge you with two journeys, you should go via Torrassa instead although its way longer. All trains are air-conditioned, but the metro stations themselves are not, so beware because the stations can become very hot during summer months.\nAlso be aware when travelling to/from the airport by Metro line L9 Sud: while the T-casual is valid for\nR2\nNORD\nRenfe services (or buses), it is not accepted for the\nMetro. If you use the Metro line L9 Sud to and from the airport using a T-casual ticket, you'll be forced to pay the full fare, which is €5.50, and the ticket you've used will not be refunded."

    "text": "Get around\n[\nedit\n]\n36°43′12″N 4°25′15″W\nThe city centre of Malaga\nBy foot\n[\nedit\n]\nThe best way to get an impression of Málaga is to discover the charming corners, stunning sights and lovely neighbourhoods by wandering the streets and narrow roads on foot: take a stop for churros con chocolate, ice-cream, a coffee or some tapas and enjoy the Andalusian atmosphere.\nBy bicycle\n[\nedit\n]\nMálaga is making big improvements when it comes to cycling. Nowadays Malagueños use their bikes more often to go to work or for recreational use in the weekends. Also Málaga established a cycling association supported by the local public transport association. The use of bicycles is promoted as being eco-friendly, fun, safe and healthy. Promotional campaigns in the form of group cycle activities or excursions outside Málaga are being introduced and this has led to big success.\nMeanwhile, Málaga also constructed several bike lanes. Due to this construction the centre is also better connected with the northern part of the city. The historical centre of Málaga is already free of motorized vehicles, which makes cycling much safer than in the past. Also spots like the boulevard and the harbour are only accessible for pedestrians and cyclists. This 2-km-long boulevard is wide enough for cyclists to enjoy and cycle in a relaxing fashion.\nBesides cycling in the city the coast area of Málaga is also worth exploring by bike. Going east from Málaga is probably the most popular route as it's possible to travel along a route through the twin traditional fishing villages of Pedregalejo and El Palo all the way to the end of Rincon De La Victoria without going on the main road. Travelling west along the coast is not quite as straightforward, for example biking from Málaga to Torremolinos is a popular route but it is difficult to find a good route away from busy highways but it is possible.\nCycling inland north from Málaga is characterized by steep climbs with little in the way of long easy winding routes. The Montes de Málaga is probably the most notable mountain route from the city where an elevation of over 900 m can be reached in less than 15 km, this route is known locally as \"The Reina\" and is not for the lazy cyclist. Other notable climbs include a section known locally as \"The Wall\" which is a terrifying descent or climber's challenge depending on what direction it's cycled. \"The Wall\" is a 9 km section between Moclinejo and Almáchar (this is the terrifying descent direction) on an inland route from Malaga to the coastal resort of Torre Del Mar.\nAn alternative mountain route for the committed cyclist is around the \"Sierra de Mijas\". The route goes west from Málaga on quite a busy main road past the airport, then up a steep country road to the white villages of Benalmadena Pueblo and Mijas Pueblo, dropping down then to Alhaurin el Grande and back on the north side of Sierra de Mijas to Málaga via Alhaurin de la Torre.\nEscapada Cycling\n,\nPlaza Poeta Alfonso Canales\n.\n10:00 - 20:00\n.\nHigh-end road bike hire.\nstarts from €35/day\n.\n(\nupdated Apr 2019\n)\nBy public transport\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are several public transport options (bus, metro & local trains) which can save you the hassle of parking a car.\nWith the green travel card of\nCTMAM\nyou can use all means of public transport in and around Malaga (metro, commuter trains (Cercanías), city and regional buses) for a lower price. The card can be bought in tobacco shops for €1.50 and must be charged with at least €5 (Nov 2024). There are other travel cards from Metro Málaga (covers city buses as well) & EMT Tarjeta Transbordo (see below) but this card is for buses only.\nMetro Málaga\n[dead link]\nis a small two line light metro service that covers parts of the city. Line\n1\nruns West from the centre, while Line\n2\nruns South. You can used a contactless bank card on the barriers for a cost of €1.35 if your card is unregistered. If you register your bank card you will be charged a lower price. Both lines come together at the El Perchel (Maria Zambrano) station, from where you can also access the AVE, the Media Distancia, Regionales and Cercanías train networks at Maria Zambrano station, as well as the intercity bus station.\nEMT City Buses\n[dead link]\nThere is a comprehensive network of city buses. Most buses call at the Alameda Principal near the Atarazanas metro station. (The EMT website and Metro Malaga are geoblocked for users outside (or appearing to be outside) Spain. If you have difficulty accessing them locally, try WiFi.) Journey planning can be done using Google Maps or Moovit. A single ride costs €1.40 (Nov 2024) which can be paid by contactless card. For using the city buses more often buy a Tarjeta Transbordo for €1.90 and charge it with €4.20 for 10 rides (Nov 2024). The Transbordo card can only be used for the city buses, not for other means of public transport.\nCommuter Trains\n(\nCercanías\n) There are two lines C-1 & C-2 which both call at Málaga Centro Alameda, Maria Zambrano (for mainline trains, trams & buses) & Victoria Kent.  Extending well beyond the city there are two lines C-1 runs South West to Fuengirola calling at the Airport & Torremolinos amongst many other places. C-2 runs approximately North West to Alora. You can load the tickets onto +Renfe & Tú Contactless Card or an easier way is to use a contactless bank card at the carriers.\nRegional buses are controlled by\nCTMAM\n.\nCar parking Malaga airport\n[\nedit\n]\nIf you want to park at Malaga airport, there are many private car parks around the airport which are much cheaper than the official airport car park.\nBy car rental\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are many car rental companies in Malaga. Most of them are located near the airport."

Even in big cities, only a few areas (San Francisco in Bilbao, for example) are best avoided. Although violent crime is extremely rare, the usual precautions still apply; avoid being alone at night in side streets, keep an eye on pickpockets, and you should do just fine.\nThe ETA, which regarded itself the Basque national liberation army, declared a permanent ceasefire and cessation of armed activity in 2011, and surrendered its weapons to the French authorities in 2017. It never targeted visitors.\nAlthough they have also become rarer, there is a chance of seeing acts of vandalism related to radical pro-independence movements, specially if you visit the Basque Country during a big pro-independence-demonstration day or politically relevant dates (the Gudari Eguna, the Aberri Eguna and some city festivals). Don't be alarmed, if you find yourself in the middle of a fight between the police and violent demonstrators: do what the Basques do, and go to the next street. In 30 minutes, everything will be probably finished.\nIt is advisable not to wear any Spanish symbols (Spain's national football (soccer) team T-shirts, Spanish flags or Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid club paraphernalia).

    "text": "History\n[\nedit\n]\nTemple of Debod with Torre de Madrid and Edificio Espana in the background\nMadrid is a city that goes back to the Spanish Muslims, but virtually nothing of Madrid before the Reconquista is left. A few historic city walls have been archeologically preserved but Madrid was by far overshadowed by\nToledo\n(Roman\nToletum\n) until the early modern era. To give just one example, construction on Madrid Cathedral did not start until the late 19th century, and only finished in the 1990s, as the archbishop of Toledo did not want to relinquish episcopal power, and the monarchs had moved the capital in part precisely to escape the power of Toledo's archbishop.\nThe culture of Madrid was dominated by its royal history, centre of the Spanish Empire. The Royal Palace, big plazas and buildings used by the Spanish Monarchy, enormous cathedrals and churches are plentiful in Madrid. Madrid is now just as much a cosmopolitan city as\nBerlin\nor\nLondon\n: full of modern architecture, lifestyle and culture.\nMadrid became capital of\nSpain\nunder Philip II who had a gargantuan palace built in nearby\nEl Escorial\n. For a long while, Madrid would be the royal residence first, only becoming a city much later. Madrid architecture often reflects the era in which it was built. The Spanish Habsburgs (\"Los Austrias\") who reigned until the death of unfortunate Charles II in 1700 predominantly used red brick for facades and black schist for the roofs. The later Bourbon dynasty (ruling today after the two Republican interludes) preferred granite to brick, giving their buildings a greyer tone. The king that had the largest influence on Madrid after Philip II was perhaps Charles III. He was nicknamed \"el Rey Alcalde\" (the mayor-king) or \"Madrid's best mayor\" due to his extensive building and modernisation programmes in the city. Other royal projects that left their mark are Isabel II's freshwater canal, and the metro which was started in 1919 with King Alfonso XIII's own money. However, both those monarchs were so unpopular that they were later overthrown by their own people, giving rise to the First and Second Spanish Republics.\nBeing the capital of Spain, Madrid came to be associated - justly or not, for better and for worse - with the governing trends in Spain by Spaniards in other parts of the country. As the governing trends swung widely from anti-clerical Republic to hyper-catholic fascist Franco dictatorship, this has influenced the perception of Madrid in the rest of Spain. During the 2nd Republic (1931-1936), it was a bustling city of new ideas with many political issues of the day literally fought out on the streets of Madrid. During the Civil War, Madrid endured a three year siege (1936-1939) by the anti-Republican troops and was one of the last places to hold out for the Republic. During the dictatorship of Francisco Franco (1939-1975), the city represented the heart of the repressive hyper-conservative dictatorship to many Spaniards, particularly Basques and Catalans. However, the city is also the epicentre of the famous Movida of the 1980s, a Spanish movement that bred personalities such as the director Pedro Almodóvar. The heritage of this era is indeed still visible in the city centre, where a party can be found at all times and one of the most liberal and colourful environments of Spain can be seen. The city is also known for its acceptance of LGBT people."

You will find seafood and a wide range of products made from pork-- the whole animal is eaten, even the blood. Galicia is definitely the place to go if you like seafood and fish, since Galicia is by itself a world fishing power (for example, almost half the mussels in the world are 'harvested' in Galicia).\nMarisco\nThe best seafood in Spain is served in Galicia. Don't miss the \"centollo\", \"nécoras,\" and \"percebes\". The mussels are superb, and various types of shrimp and prawns can be found at any seafood restaurant or seafood market.\nAlmeixas a Mariñeira\nor Almejas a la Marinera – Clams prepared with wine, olive oil, and \"pimentón\" (paprika).\nEmpanada\n- a mixture between a pizza and a meatcake. Empanadas have a wide variety of fillings from tuna fish to beef to octopus.\nPolbo á feira\n– octopus prepared with oil, salt and hot paprika - surely the best octopus you'll ever find.\nCaldo galego\nis a \"poor mans stew\" from Galicia. It's not extravagant, but extremely satisfying and useful for combating the cool dampness of the region.\nBacallau ao alvariño\nis a fabulous cod dish that is worth trying.\nPimientos de Padrón\nare green chili peppers, picked early so that only a few in each batch are spicy; these are eaten sautéed with salt (see drink section)\nRaxo\n– stewed meat pieces, generally made of pork loin which might have been stewed with onions or red pepper or in cream.\nAside from the typical Spanish three-course menu it's quite usual to take\nraciones\nof food. Keep in mind that raciones might be quite big and sometimes they were thought to serve two persons, so you might want a smaller one – these are announced as tapas or\nmedia raciones\n. In many bars in Galicia you will get a small tapa for your drink, too. Thus, bar hopping can also be an alternative for taking a series of small meals.\nGalicia also has a lot of good desserts. The various bakeries and pastry shops throughout the region have delicious pastries and cookies. Churros are common throughout the region. While in Santiago de Compostela, look out for a tarta de Santiago, an almond cake with the Galician Cross (also known as the Cross of Santiago) drawn into the icing. Also look out for \"filloas,\" which are similar to crepes and often filled with sugar or custard cream."

The 2000s saw a more nuanced approach by Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón, also of the PP, who focused on upgrading Madrid's ring road (the M30), expanding the metro system, and liberalising the economy. The 2008 financial crisis hit Madrid hard, which gave rise to ex-communist Manuela Carmena in the 2010s. Despite showing early promises, Carmena's popularity dwindled, and the PP's José Luis Martínez-Almeida ousted her as mayor by winning the 2019 elections forming a governing coalition with two new political parties: the centrist Ciudadanos and the far-right Vox. This rightwards shift reinforced itself with the popularity of Isabel Diaz Ayuso, the PP president of the Community of Madrid."

It's like Russian Roulette for your taste buds). Keep your drink handy and partake with a few friends.\nThe most famous wine in Galicia is Albariño, one of the best white wines in Spain. Also readily available are Ribeiro (white), Godello (white), and mencía (red).

Also Málaga established a cycling association supported by the local public transport association. The use of bicycles is promoted as being eco-friendly, fun, safe and healthy. Promotional campaigns in the form of group cycle activities or excursions outside Málaga are being introduced and this has led to big success.\nMeanwhile, Málaga also constructed several bike lanes. Due to this construction the centre is also better connected with the northern part of the city. The historical centre of Málaga is already free of motorized vehicles, which makes cycling much safer than in the past. Also spots like the boulevard and the harbour are only accessible for pedestrians and cyclists. This 2-km-long boulevard is wide enough for cyclists to enjoy and cycle in a relaxing fashion.\nBesides cycling in the city the coast area of Málaga is also worth exploring by bike. Going east from Málaga is probably the most popular route as it's possible to travel along a route through the twin traditional fishing villages of Pedregalejo and El Palo all the way to the end of Rincon De La Victoria without going on the main road. Travelling west along the coast is not quite as straightforward, for example biking from Málaga to Torremolinos is a popular route but it is difficult to find a good route away from busy highways but it is possible.\nCycling inland north from Málaga is characterized by steep climbs with little in the way of long easy winding routes. The Montes de Málaga is probably the most notable mountain route from the city where an elevation of over 900 m can be reached in less than 15 km, this route is known locally as \"The Reina\" and is not for the lazy cyclist. Other notable climbs include a section known locally as \"The Wall\" which is a terrifying descent or climber's challenge depending on what direction it's cycled. \"The Wall\" is a 9 km section between Moclinejo and Almáchar (this is the terrifying descent direction) on an inland route from Malaga to the coastal resort of Torre Del Mar.\nAn alternative mountain route for the committed cyclist is around the \"Sierra de Mijas\". The route goes west from Málaga on quite a busy main road past the airport, then up a steep country road to the white villages of Benalmadena Pueblo and Mijas Pueblo, dropping down then to Alhaurin el Grande and back on the north side of Sierra de Mijas to Málaga via Alhaurin de la Torre.\nEscapada Cycling\n,\nPlaza Poeta Alfonso Canales\n.\n10:00 - 20:00\n.\nHigh-end road bike hire.\nstarts from €35/day\n.\n(\nupdated Apr 2019\n)"

Historians are still unsure of their significance.\nThe harbour at\nMaó\n, the island capital, is the second largest natural deep water port in the world - the largest being Pearl Harbour. The whole island is a European Biological Reserve and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve aiming to preserve environmental areas. More than 75% of the territory is protected. You can watch some of the last turtles of the Mediterranean, birds and protected species.\nThe main tourist area is along the south coast and includes the resorts of Santo Tomas, Son Bou, Cala en Porter, Binibeca, Punta Prima and S'Algar. Menorca is a relatively quiet island, which means more wholesome, family fun holidays. If you prefer a more vibrant night scene, head to nearby Ibiza or Mallorca for a bustling city atmosphere.\nAn identifying sign of Menorca is its fascination with horses. All things centre around horses and the people love them. Menorca has its own race of black horses. In all the festivities the horses and their \"caixers\" (riders) are the centrepieces. The \"Cami de Cavalls\" is a pathway surrounding the island for horse riding and it was used in the past for defense of the coast by horse, literally translating to\nhorse path\n.\nIf you do take time to explore the interior you will discover a wealth of interesting and historic landmarks from El Toro (the highest point on the island) to the most significant prehistoric sites at Trepucó and Torre d’en Galmés.\nTo this day no one is certain of the significance of these prehistoric monuments in the form of Taules, T-shaped stone formations thought to be spiritual sanctuaries; Talayots which are stone towers that local people believe were once used as look-out points. There is little evidence to support these theories about Menorca’s prehistoric past nor the original function of these breathtaking creations . Taules are named after the Menorquí word for table. (Menorquí is the local dialect of Catalan which is widely spoken on the Island). Menorca is by far the richest place in Europe for sites of prehistoric settlements, mostly dating from the Talaiotic Period, which was the period of civilisation between 2000 and 1000 BC. The term Talayot is believed to originate from the Arabic atalaya  meaning “watch tower”.\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nSince prehistoric times, the Island has been controlled by the Romans, Moors, Catalans, Spanish, French and English. All these nations have left their mark on the Island and monuments to visit from Sanisera, the archaeological site close the port of Sanitja on the north coast of the island to the ruins of the 5th century Bascilica on the beach at Son Bou.\nDuring the 18th century, Menorca was a bone of contention among the British, French and Spanish powers. This was due to the Port of Maó, the finest natural harbour in the Mediterranean, and one of the best in the world, which could protect the largest fleets of the time in their entirety. The Utrecht Treaty, signed in 1713, gave place to the first British presence on Menorca, which lasted until 1755. The first British Governor was John Campbell (Argyll) nominated by the Queen Anne. Richard Kane, from County Antrim in Ireland, the second British Governor, is still fondly remembered for his effective support of agriculture on the island; he introduced the cultivation of the apple, promoted cattle breeding and built roads and reservoirs which are still in use today. The Scottish Col. Patrick Mackellar (Argyll) was the chief engineer of Menorca and responsible for the main constructions of the British legacy. The main contribution of Mackellar was the design and construction of Georgestown (Es Castell) near to Sant Felip fortress at the entry of Mahon harbour.\nThere were two later periods of British presence on Menorca, from 1763 till 1781 and 1798 to 1808. The British left more than their earthworks and ramparts behind. This included things as varied as the growth of Maó, which enthusiastically accepted the opportunities for trade and the abolition of the Inquisition, the traditional woodworking and boat building techniques and designs and Menorca's most popular drink, gin."

Wrongly ignored by some tourists, they provide a useful additional mode of transport for getting across the city or connecting with mainline rail services and the airport.\nThe trains run by RENFE share tracks with mainline trains and are called Rodalies\n(known in the rest of Spain as Cercanías).

NOTE that the integrated system\nmap\nshows fare zones that do not coincide with the integrated transport zones of different transportation companies but the integrated fare Zone 1 is shown with the addition of the airport T2 station on\nR2\nNORD\n. However, due to chronic underfunding severe disruptions are more the norm than the exception (as of March 2025, the service on line R3 had been completely suspended, without expectations of either restoration the same day or any replacement services), so seriously consider other alternatives before choosing RENFE-operated trains.\nThe trains run by\nFGC\nare\nS1\nS2\nS3\nS4\nS8\nS9\nand some are confusingly prefixed with an R\nR5\nR50\nR6\nR60\n.

They live by a daily routine that is heavily influenced by the climate. Due to the typically midday heat during summer, a \"siesta\" can be still observed during which some citizens take a break to cool off, though\nMadrileños\ncan usually only afford this 'luxury' during holidays and weekends.\nMost stores are open throughout the day; just small stores are often closed during siesta. Workers and those more afflicted by Western lifestyles choose not to observe this long break and work usually between 09:00 and 18:00-19:00. However, during summer, many offices have a summer schedule requiring workers to start at 08:00 and finish at 15:00 (most commonly without the standard 1-2 hour break for lunch).\nOffices usually close over the weekend but businesses are often open Saturday morning, or until the afternoon in the city centre. Most grocers are closed on Sundays, but some major chain and department stores linked to \"culture\" (books, music, etc.) will be open every day. Shops and department stores in Puerta del Sol area are open every day.\nMadrid has a very modern and elaborate transportation network of buses and Metro with a few \"Light Metro\" tram lines in the outskirts. The city contrasts with some large European cities in that it is extremely clean, and city employees in bright yellow vests can almost always be seen cleaning the streets and sidewalks. Like most large cities, however, there is a substantial population of vagrants and beggars lining the streets.\nMadrid is one of the biggest and most cosmopolitan cities in Europe. Communities of West Africans, North Africans, other Europeans (especially Romanians), Chinese, Filipinos, Pakistanis, and above all Latin Americans are prominent."

    "text": "Understand\n[\nedit\n]\nGranada and the Alhambra\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nGranada has been continuously inhabited by humans for at least 2500 years, originating as an Ibero-Celtic settlement prior to the establishment of a Greek colony in the area. Under Ancient Roman rule Granada developed as an economic center of Roman Hispania, with the construction of aqueducts, roads, and other infrastructure. With the fall of the\nRoman Empire\nthe city was ruled by the Visigoths before being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire, all the time being maintained as a strategic military and economic center for the region.\nThe Moorish conquest of 711 CE brought Islamic rule to the Iberian Peninsula and Granada was quickly established as a center of Al-Andalus, the Muslim name for the region. New agricultural practices were introduced as the old Roman infrastructure was put to use for irrigation, leading to a major expansion of the city as it grew from the river valley up to the hills now occupied by the Alhambra and the Albayzín, with a major Jewish settlement, the Realejo, existing within the town. Following the fall of Córdoba in 1236 to the Christian Reconquista, the city became the center of the Emirate of Granada, and for the next 250 years Granada stood as the heart of a powerful and self-sufficient kingdom with the construction of the royal palace and fortress, the Alhambra.\nSkirmishes continued between the Emirate of Granada and the Crown of Castile, and in the late 15th century the Christian Reconquista set its sights on Granada. Following a military campaign led by King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, which included a siege of the walled town, King Boabdil of Granada was ultimately forced to surrender the town in 1492, bringing an end to Moorish rule in the Iberian peninsula and marking the end of the Reconquista.\nThe fall of Granada came at a crucial moment for Christian Spain, as it was that same year that Christopher Columbus made his first voyage to the Americas, bringing back reports of the wealth and resources that could be gained there. Flushed with the success of the Reconquista, Spaniards conquered much of the Americas and brought great wealth to the new Spanish Empire. In the case of Granada, the Christians soon forced the existing Jewish and Muslim residents to convert and began making significant changes to the appearance of the city in an attempt to hide its Muslim character, including replacing the city's primary mosque with the massive cathedral and constructing a large Christian palace in the heart of the Alhambra. Persecution against the Muslims and Jews took its toll, and over time the city began to suffer economically as these populations abandoned their homes in the area.\nGranada remained a largely medieval-style city well into the 19th century, going through many economic slumps and seeing much of its architectural heritage destroyed. However, the last half of the 19th century saw Granada incorporated into the national rail network and the first stirrings of tourism thanks to reports of sites like the Alhambra to a global audience. However, the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s sunk Granada's economy, and it persisted largely as a bureaucratic and university town until the late 20th century, when the city underwent a massive period of modernization and development which brought new business and visitors to the city. Today you can still see this modernization in the reconstruction of old buildings in the city center and expansion of the town along the edges of the city.\nClimate\n[\nedit\n]\nGranada\nClimate chart (\nexplanation\n)\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\n44\n12\n1\n36\n14\n3\n37\n17\n4\n40\n19\n6\n30\n23\n10\n16\n29\n14\n3\n34\n17\n3\n33\n17\n17\n28\n14\n40\n21\n10\n46\n16\n5\n49\n13\n3\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °C\nPrecipitation\n+\nSnow\ntotals in mm\nImperial conversion\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\n1.7\n54\n34\n1.4\n57\n37\n1.5\n63\n39\n1.6\n66\n43\n1.2\n73\n50\n0.6\n84\n57\n0.1\n93\n63\n0.1\n91\n63\n0.7\n82\n57\n1.6\n70\n50\n1.8\n61\n41\n1.9\n55\n37\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °F\nPrecipitation\n+\nSnow\ntotals in inches\nGranada has a fairly mild climate; hot summers and short but cold winters with a mild amount of precipitation.

Rain is most common in the fall and early winter months and rain spells lasting several days can occur during this time of the year, but the rest of the year you're likely to see little else but sunshine.

This was due to the Port of Maó, the finest natural harbour in the Mediterranean, and one of the best in the world, which could protect the largest fleets of the time in their entirety. The Utrecht Treaty, signed in 1713, gave place to the first British presence on Menorca, which lasted until 1755. The first British Governor was John Campbell (Argyll) nominated by the Queen Anne. Richard Kane, from County Antrim in Ireland, the second British Governor, is still fondly remembered for his effective support of agriculture on the island; he introduced the cultivation of the apple, promoted cattle breeding and built roads and reservoirs which are still in use today. The Scottish Col. Patrick Mackellar (Argyll) was the chief engineer of Menorca and responsible for the main constructions of the British legacy. The main contribution of Mackellar was the design and construction of Georgestown (Es Castell) near to Sant Felip fortress at the entry of Mahon harbour.\nThere were two later periods of British presence on Menorca, from 1763 till 1781 and 1798 to 1808. The British left more than their earthworks and ramparts behind. This included things as varied as the growth of Maó, which enthusiastically accepted the opportunities for trade and the abolition of the Inquisition, the traditional woodworking and boat building techniques and designs and Menorca's most popular drink, gin."

    "text": "Do\n[\nedit\n]\nBeach in Lagunas de Ruidera\nSince the 1960s boom, tourism to Spain is mainly directed towards sun, beach and party. While La Mancha is a landlocked region, it has some traditional summer resorts and other bathing areas, similarly to Costa Dulce in Orellana la Vieja, in nearby Badajoz, Extremadura. A good swim can be especially helpful during summer season, when temperatures can sometimes reach 40ºC.\nLagunas de Ruidera: is the main summer resort area in La Mancha, located along the provincial border of Ciudad Real and Albacete. A chain of lagoons of the Pinilla river (often called erroneously Guadiana Viejo or Old Guadiana) along a valley, surrounded by some beautiful vegetation, and often connected to each other by waterfalls. It is classified as a Natural Park (second tier in the Spanish park system). The main lagoons are located south of the N-430, the old Lisbon-Valencia road (largely replaced by the A-43, through a different route). However, the most exclusive and beach-like lagoon, Laguna Blanca, is located near the CR-640 road between Villahermosa and Ossa de Montiel (the road is also known as AB-610 in the Albacete province).\nLagunas de Villafranca: a few generations ago, these lagoons on the Cigüela river were a bustling summer resort right in the middle of La Mancha. However, with the advent of automobiles and seaside tourist resorts, Manchegos started holidaying in those latter places, deserting Villafranca. One more reason for this change was the muddy floor of the lagoons.\nRío Bullaque: is one of the mightiest tributaries of the Guadiana in the area, coming from the Montes de Toledo mountains, between Cabañeros NP and Retuerta del Bullaque. Some of the best bathing areas along the river are located in El Torno and El Robledo. In the latter, there is a designated area known as \"Zona de Baño\". However, there is an additional less crowded area near Bar Pepe and the Healthcare Centre (Centro de Salud).\nConfluencia de Solanilla: this little-known spot is located on a side of road CR-5011, connecting Mestanza with the old Pontones mines. Here, the Montoro and Fresneda rivers merge into each other creating the Jándula or Riofrío river, with an impressive canyon downstream. To see the area in Google Maps, it is located just between Puente Montoro (bridge over the Montoro) and Estrecho de Riofrío (river canyon).\nAnother alternative for travellers in La Mancha to survive the scorching Manchego summer heat, apart from\nsiesta\nas widely done by locals, would be the use of local public swimming pools, that can be found as either Piscina Municipal (usually open only in summer) or Piscina Climatizada/Cubierta (indoor pool, usually open year-round)."

    "text": "By bus\n[\nedit\n]\nAn articulated Barcelona city bus\nThe\nbus network\nin Barcelona is pretty extensive. Perhaps the best option in planning your route is to consult with one of the route planners mentioned above.\nA major reorganisation of bus lines was completed in November 2018, so disregard old bus schedules and recheck routes. For example, bus line 92 to Park Güell, used by many tourists to get there after a visit to the Sagrada Familia, has been suspended, and a new line V15 stops there but takes a different route through the city centre (Passeig de Sant Joan).\nHere are some tips for bus line codes:\nHxx lines run parallel to the coastline, low numbers run on the high side, high numbers on the sea side.\nVxx lines run from the beach to the hills, high numbers on the northern side (Besòs), low numbers on the southern (Llobregat).\nDxx lines run in a somewhat diagonal path, although interestingly none of these cover neither Diagonal or Meridiana avenues, the main oblique streets.\nMxx lines are found at the outer perimeter of metro coverage and link a metro stop to a neighbourhood lacking metro service.\nBxx lines run on the northern area outside Barcelona or linking Barcelona to neighbouring municipalities in the metropolitan area, B stands for Besòs river.\nLxx lines run on the southern area alike Bxx lines, L stands for Llobregat river.\nSome municipalities have lines fully inside the town limits with two letters and a digit, theses two letters are reminiscent of the town name, such as BDx for Badalona and LHx for L'Hospitalet\nNxx lines run only at night when all other lines do not run, roughly from 23:00 to 6:00.\nCxx lines link Barcelona the various northern coastal Maresme towns up to\nMataró\n.\nExx lines are express buses from Barcelona to various municipalities 10–60 km (6.2–37.3 mi) outside of the metropolitan area.\nLines with one or two digits without any letter follow historical routes from before the H-V-D schema.\nLines between 100 and 199 are usually very local lines served with low-capacity cars and poor frequency, 30 min or worse. Notable cases are line 111 to the Tibidabo amusement park, line 120 through Ciutat Vella, and line 150 to Olympic venues and the Montjuïc castle; others are mostly useless for tourists.\nLine numbers from 200 upwards are used for some routes going outside the metropolitan area, while some others of the same kind have no number at all.\nBuses H-V-D run about every 6–12 min weekdays, 15–20 min weekends.\nNitbus (N) run every 20 min all night.\nInformation is available from AMB\nAll Nitbuses (except N0 & N19) start or pass through Pl Catalunya\nTake note that some lines have special fare restrictions: Barcelona cards (unlimited travel for 2 to 5 days) are valid only on Hxx, Vxx, Dxx and line numbers below 200. Fare 1 travelcards are not valid for Cxx, Exx and line numbers above 200 – actually, trips fully inside fare zone 1 are not permitted on these lines no matter what ticket is used. If you board any of these buses inside fare zone 1 you won't be able to get off until reaching another fare zone.\nBarcelona Bus Turístic\n.\nThis bus has three routes (map provided as you board), including a northbound and a southbound line that leave from opposite sides of the\nPlaça de Catalunya\n. Each takes 1–2 hours. The hop-on/hop-off format lets you get-off at any interesting stop, see what interests you, then get back on any later bus at that or any other stop. One approach is stay on for an entire route, then continue while getting off at locations that interested you earlier. Buses are double-decked, with the open-air upper deck offering much better views – but sunscreen is essential in summer months, jackets in winter, early spring and late autumn. Earphones are offered when you first get on so you can hear the commentary as you drive by significant locations. Outlets near every seat let you choose among many languages and playback volumes. The buses are very frequent. For a cheaper option with more flexibility in routes opt for the metro and the T-casual.\nAdult prices: 1 day ticket €33, 2 days €44; tickets can be bought at the bus stops, some hotels, etc. or\nonline with 10% discount\n.\n(\nupdated Mar 2024\n)"

    "text": "History\n[\nedit\n]\nGranada has been continuously inhabited by humans for at least 2500 years, originating as an Ibero-Celtic settlement prior to the establishment of a Greek colony in the area. Under Ancient Roman rule Granada developed as an economic center of Roman Hispania, with the construction of aqueducts, roads, and other infrastructure. With the fall of the\nRoman Empire\nthe city was ruled by the Visigoths before being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire, all the time being maintained as a strategic military and economic center for the region.\nThe Moorish conquest of 711 CE brought Islamic rule to the Iberian Peninsula and Granada was quickly established as a center of Al-Andalus, the Muslim name for the region. New agricultural practices were introduced as the old Roman infrastructure was put to use for irrigation, leading to a major expansion of the city as it grew from the river valley up to the hills now occupied by the Alhambra and the Albayzín, with a major Jewish settlement, the Realejo, existing within the town. Following the fall of Córdoba in 1236 to the Christian Reconquista, the city became the center of the Emirate of Granada, and for the next 250 years Granada stood as the heart of a powerful and self-sufficient kingdom with the construction of the royal palace and fortress, the Alhambra.\nSkirmishes continued between the Emirate of Granada and the Crown of Castile, and in the late 15th century the Christian Reconquista set its sights on Granada. Following a military campaign led by King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, which included a siege of the walled town, King Boabdil of Granada was ultimately forced to surrender the town in 1492, bringing an end to Moorish rule in the Iberian peninsula and marking the end of the Reconquista.\nThe fall of Granada came at a crucial moment for Christian Spain, as it was that same year that Christopher Columbus made his first voyage to the Americas, bringing back reports of the wealth and resources that could be gained there. Flushed with the success of the Reconquista, Spaniards conquered much of the Americas and brought great wealth to the new Spanish Empire. In the case of Granada, the Christians soon forced the existing Jewish and Muslim residents to convert and began making significant changes to the appearance of the city in an attempt to hide its Muslim character, including replacing the city's primary mosque with the massive cathedral and constructing a large Christian palace in the heart of the Alhambra. Persecution against the Muslims and Jews took its toll, and over time the city began to suffer economically as these populations abandoned their homes in the area.\nGranada remained a largely medieval-style city well into the 19th century, going through many economic slumps and seeing much of its architectural heritage destroyed. However, the last half of the 19th century saw Granada incorporated into the national rail network and the first stirrings of tourism thanks to reports of sites like the Alhambra to a global audience. However, the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s sunk Granada's economy, and it persisted largely as a bureaucratic and university town until the late 20th century, when the city underwent a massive period of modernization and development which brought new business and visitors to the city. Today you can still see this modernization in the reconstruction of old buildings in the city center and expansion of the town along the edges of the city."

While you should be fine if you keep out of politics altogether and the Catalan population is pretty much evenly split in pro- and anti-independence camps, even peaceful protests can become violent without much advance notice so as a visitor, you are advised to just stay away from protests.

    "text": "Respect\n[\nedit\n]\nGalician people are normally welcoming and like to have the occasional chat with visitors but, paradoxically, they also have a reputation for being reserved people. Indeed, their trust may be hard to earn at first, but if it is achieved, they will be open and honest with you. Address people politely, even formally if necessary, as this will always cause a first good impression and will open many doors. Also, remember that your word is your bond, especially in rural areas. Do not promise anything nor 'give your word' if you are not intending to fulfill it. Spoken agreements may be as binding as written ones for everyday issues in the eyes of a Galician (namely, in rural areas).\nGalicians often like to exchange stories, where you may find yourself doing most of the talking. That being said, locals will indeed enjoy that with some amusement. Do not expect to master the Galician conversational code in just a few days. There is an intricate combination of idioms, gestures, and silences, too. The fact that you don’t know it and/or that you use a different one is what Galicians often find interesting in visitors.\nIf offered a similar gift, you are not to accept it straight away. A polite refusal is expected. Take it, eventually, if insisted upon; you are not necessarily expected to give anything back. Do not decline invitations for food or drink after a first or second polite refusal, especially in rural areas, as this may be considered rude. If you absolutely do not wish to eat or drink what you are offered, state medical reasons (a white lie), as that will indeed be respected by your Galician host. If you give a gift, do not expect something in exchange immediately. Trading gifts and favours in Galicia has also got its own code and you may be paid back in time, or if you ever go back.\nDo not openly discuss financial issues in public gatherings as a general rule. Try to avoid talking about money or asking about money and finances, unless you are conducting a specific business. Avoid talking about politics even if you think you know Spanish politics. Partisan and personal loyalties in Galicia work in a completely different way. The issue of Galician and Portuguese being one language should also be avoided unless you know the person you are talking to very well and have some background knowledge on the matter. The Galician situation is radically different to the one in the Basque Country or Catalonia for that matter; it is full of grey areas.\nRespect local customs and traditions; do not mock superstitions regardless of how strange they may seem to you. Galicians may tell you it is all \"nonsense\", but they still will not like you judging them."

Try to remember that you are a guest in another country and respect the fact that even though you are on vacation, most of the people around you live here and are trying to go about their normal lives. For example, avoid making a lot of noise late at night, as people will be sleeping.\nBe aware that people usually have breakfast at 9AM, lunch at 2PM and dinner at 9PM or later. This schedule may seem a little weird but it is like this because of the sun hours. Traditionally, people worked the fields when the sun was least strong, which is early morning and late afternoon. So after working from dawn, they had a snack at 9AM or 10AM, ate lunch at 2PM, then back to work between 3PM and 4PM, after which they would come home and eat dinner at 9PM. The tradition as a whole is gradually disappearing, due to increased urbanization and the abandonment of traditional farming practices, but people have largely kept the eating schedule.\nCatalonia has an active independence movement, and Catalan society is deeply divided on this issue. As a visitor, tread lightly in discussions of the issue."

Rain is most common in the fall and early winter months and rain spells lasting several days can occur during this time of the year, but the rest of the year you're likely to see little else but sunshine.

The ruins of the Roman circus are still visible just outside the walls of the city.  Roman occupation was followed by\nVisigoth\nrule,\nMuslim rule\nand finally the Reconquest of Toledo in AD 1085. Toledo was the capital of the Spanish empire until the mid-1500s when the royal court moved to Madrid.  The winding, cobbled streets of the old town are often crowded with locals and tourists, as well as a surprisingly large number of cars and vans. Don't miss the 13th century cathedral or the Alcázar which sits atop the town and dates back to Roman times.\nAs a visitor to Toledo, you are not allowed to pick up or collect anything off the street because the entire city is a gazetted monument. However, there are souvenir shops where one can buy mementoes. You get a better view of the ancient city as you enjoy local meals in one of the hotels across from the banks of the Tagus River."

Madrid can be reached from\nParis\nand other cities in France and beyond also by changing in Barcelona. However for the French Atlantic coast (e.g.\nBayonne\nand\nBordeaux\n) it is quicker to travel via\nHendaye\n.\nTropical garden in Atocha\nMadrid has two mainline railway stations, Atocha and Chamartín, both with extensive Metro and local Cercanías train connections. To transfer between them, take Metro line\n1\n(€1.50 or 1 journey, 30–40 min) or Cercanías lines\nC-3\nand\nC-4\n(€1.35, 15 min).\nAll rail stations are operated by the national rail infrastructure company\nADIF\n, you can check train running times & platforms there and on their app. Remember local Cercanías trains are listed separately to longer distance ones.\nMost mainline trains run from:\n40.405807\n-3.689688\n2\nPuerta de Atocha\n(\nEstación de Atocha\n).\n1 km south of city centre, it's divided into two main sections, \"Madrid Puerta de Atocha Almudena Grandes\" for mainline and Madrid Atocha Cercanías local and regional trains. The mainline part is set inside the towering old station building, where the former track area has been converted into a retail & food mall, along with a tropical garden with a pond full of small turtles. The Cercanías part, adjacent, has a memorial to the victims of the terrorist attack of 11 March 2004. Although both parts require tickets from passengers to access the platforms, the mainline part also has airport-style security screening checkpoints for departing passengers so make sure you arrive at the station well ahead of your train’s departure time to reduce the risk of missing it due to long security queues. Knives longer than 6 cm are not allowed onboard, will be confiscated and maybe destroyed. This especially applies for train to Barcelona.\n(\nupdated Jun 2024\n)\n40.472222\n-3.682222\n3\nMadrid Chamartín Clara Campoamor\n.\nThis station is 4 km north of city centre on Metro lines\n1\nand\n10\n.

It also has a Cercanias train halt. The building is quite old, but adequate, with several bus company ticket offices, a retail corridor with a couple of cafes, and toilets.\nBuses to the north, e.g.\nBarcelona\nand\nBilbao\n, run from\n40.43818\n-3.6764\n5\nEstación de Avenida de América\n(\nAvda de América, 9\n), 2 km northeast of the centre.

    "text": "Eat\n[\nedit\n]\nWhite wine and\njamón\n(ham)\nSeville, like most Andalusian destinations, is known for its tapas. \"Tapa\", while it is associated with certain dishes, is actually a size and many restaurants or bars will offer a\ntapa\n,\nmedia ración\n(half serving, although sometimes enough to make a meal) and\nración\n(serving) of the same dish. There are many great tapas places around the foot of the cathedral in the centre of town. You can't go wrong; simply order one of everything to find your favourite! Some typical tapas include\ntortilla española\n(potato omelet),\npulpo gallego\n(Galician octopus),\naceitunas\n(olives),\npatatas bravas\n(spicy potatoes), and\nqueso manchego\n(sheep's milk cheese from the region of La Mancha in central Spain). Also be sure to try the\njamón\n(ham), which you often see hanging above the bar. Most of the restaurants kitchens do not open before 20:30 in the evening. Though usually some easy to prepare meals are available before that time.\nAs the quality of food is considered of a great importance in Seville, most local bars will have very good food at a low price. For an authentic and interesting meal, stop at one of the many bars, especially one which doesn't offer English menus (the prices are likely to be lower!).\nSome bars near the river, such as\nPedalquivir\nand\nEl Faro de Triana\n, offer a nice view but aren't as good of a deal in terms of the quality of the food. Another would be\nEl Patio San Eloy\n(San Eloy 9, Sevilla) where the tapas can be a little hit and miss, but where the cool staggered seating steps, fabulous décor and fruity sangria; provide a wonderful respite from the heat of the day.\nA good deal can more easily be had at less characteristic places such as\nSloppy Joe's Pizza Inn\nand\nPapasá\n.\nIf you would like to purchase your own food, head down to one of the markets close to the centre of the city, such as in Plaza Encarnación. El Corte Inglés is a larger more popular department store that you can go to for almost every need.\nDon't eat the oranges from the trees on the street, they have been sprayed to repel birds and taste awful.\nIf you're vegetarian, make sure you specify that you eat no fish or tuna as vegetarian only implies no meat here.\nThe supermarkets M.A.S. and Dia are two very popular grocery stores and have everything you need for much less money than El Corte Ingles. Additionally, Dia has its own discount brand on a lot of items. Though they are closed on Sundays (like most everything else in Sevilla) they are found throughout the city and are very easily accessible.\nBudget\n[\nedit\n]\nOld town\n[\nedit\n]\n37.38718\n-5.99566\n1\nBodeguita Romero\n,\nCalle Harinas, 10\n,\n☏\n+34 954 229 556\n.\nTu-F 09:00-17:00, 20:00-24:00; Sa 12:00-17:00, 20:00-24:00; Su 12:00-17:00\n.\nA classic neighbourhood bodega, very popular with locals and serving excellent tapas.\n(\nupdated Nov 2024\n)\n37.385688\n-5.990367\n2\nEl Librero Tapas y Quesos\n,\nPasaje de Andreu 4, Barrio de Santa Cruz\n(\nstone's throw from the Cathedral\n),\n☏\n+34 95 5276611\n,\njuanpedrogtena@hotmail.com\n.\nDoes cheese dishes, ham dishes, tapas, menu del dia, etc. Very popular with locals.\nMenu del dia €13.60 (Sept 2020).

To transfer between them land-side use the free shuttle bus. It runs 24 hours, every 5 min daytime, and takes 10 min between T1 and T4. You can also take it just between T1, T2 and T3, but it's as quick to walk. Between T4 and T4S, use the automated train. The metro also connects the two complexes but you'd have to buy a ticket for €3.

They can be somewhat expensive if using them a lot, so be careful! A taxi can be booked using Radio Taxis, which is an English speaking service. Call +34 971 367 111 and state your current location and destination.\nBy car\n[\nedit\n]\nCompanies\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are numerous agents and companies, both international and local, specialising in car hire in Menorca - both at the airport and in resorts - although it may be important to organise it from home before you arrive to avoid disappointment during peak periods. Scooter hire is also possible at some of these agencies. Car Hire companies include the International Firms, that usually cost a little more but have dedicated desks and a separate pickup facility directly at the airport, which means there's no shuttle bus and you can just drive away. Companies based at the airport are:\nHertz\n,\nAvis\n,\nEuropcar\n, and\nEnterprise\n. There are other firms dedicated to Menorca, which will often be cheaper than the main firms, but have no dedicated desk at the airport and require a shuttle bus to their offsite destinations.\nA word of warning on Car Hire: If possible, do not get a '\nfull to empty\n' fuel policy; there is no way that you will use a full tank of fuel on the tiny island of Menorca. Instead, opt for a '\nfull to full\n' policy wherever possible. It does mean you'll have to use a petrol station before your return, but you'll save the over-the-top cost of a full tank of fuel from the rental agency.\nRoads\n[\nedit\n]\nThe roads on Menorca are very simple: there is one main road, the ME-1. It connects Ciutadella and Mahon and every other major road on the island branches off it.\nBy bus\n[\nedit\n]\nIf you're planning to travel around by bus, then there are three main public bus companies in Menorca:\nTMSA\n,\nTorres\n, and\nAutos Fornells\n.\nTransportes Menorca (TMSA)\n, who run buses throughout the island, including to Ciutadella, but operate mainly around the east coast (including Maó and the Airport), as well as to many of the southern resorts. Their buses leave from the Bus Station in Maó and from Placa de Menorca in Ciutadella.\nTorres\nrun buses from Ciutadella to locations and resorts on the west coast. Their buses leave from the main plaza (Placa des Pins) in Ciutadella.\nAutos Fornells\nrun buses from the major towns to the northern resorts, including Fornells.\nThe main bus route which serves Maó, Alaior, Es Mercadal, Ferreries and Ciutadella runs along the centre of the island. Most buses leave hourly and are very inexpensive, at around €4 to €5 to travel between Ciutadella and Maó.\nYou can always find the latest timetables for every route on each operators' website.\nOn foot\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Cami de Cavalls footpath encompasses the entire island, and is a popular walking route along the coastline. It is a fully signposted long distance Spanish walking route around the edge of the island, and is a part of Spain's network of paths, the Gran Recorrido (GR) Network.  If you're planning to visit a nearby beach or resort, it's often quicker to use the Cami de Cavalls due to the island's road structure; you can walk directly to your destination instead of travelling all the way inland only to head back down to the coast again."

    "text": "By car\n[\nedit\n]\nParking around all major tourist destinations is expensive (€3/hour, €20-36/day) and the spaces are difficult to navigate, as there are several classes of public parking spaces, with complicated rules for each class. Barcelona is plagued with the same problems that plague other major European cities; massive traffic jams and extremely narrow streets in some areas, coupled with a very complicated road system. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended for tourists, especially those with no driving experience in large cities. Public transport will get you to all the major areas, and you should use that as your main mode of transport.\nHaving a driving map is essential - plan your route before you set off. Navigating with an average tourist map is frequently misleading: many streets are one-way; left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable). As an example,\nGran via de Les Corts Catalanes\nis actually a one-way northbound street between Espanya and Marina, the opposite direction is reserved for buses and taxis only.\nSome free parking spots reported by travelers are:\nNear\nMoll de Sant Bertran\n(which is south-west from\nMuseu Maritim\n) - driving at B–10, exit to WTC and make a complete round at roundabout, heading to warehouses - and park next to its employees cars.\nSomewhere near Guell Park.\nNear Font Màgica, in Plaça Espanya and the Montjuïc hill.\nGetting around by car makes sense if you plan to spend much more time driving outside the city borders than inside it - and ideally if you don't plan to park overnight at all. Otherwise, for purely in-city transportation, consider renting a scooter, or using public transportation instead."

Except for trips to peripheral areas such as the beaches or the shopping centre, there is no need to use taxis or public transport. Furthermore, almost all sidewalks have ramps at pedestrian crossings, making it accessible for people with disabilities and those with strollers.\nBy car\n[\nedit\n]\nParking in the city centre is quite challenging. However, traffic congestion is minimal, except for the area at the end of Avenida Castelar, in La Avenida, and on the roads leading to the Beni-Enzar and Frahana border crossings. Driving through the city is not difficult.\nBy rental car\n[\nedit\n]\nIn Melilla, there are car rental services available. Several companies offer car, van, and other vehicle rentals for both residents and tourists. These services allow you to rent a vehicle by the hour, day, or week, and are useful for those who need mobility during their stay in the city or for traveling to nearby locations.\n35.291596\n-2.932929\n1\nRent a Car Melilla\n,\n☏\n+34 639 19 66 60\n.\n(\nupdated Dec 2024\n)\nBy taxi\n[\nedit\n]\nThe city has an extensive taxi network, with taxis identifiable by their white colour and the emblem of the Autonomous City of Melilla on the driver's door. They also have rooftop \"modules\" with a green light to indicate whether they are available or not, along with a \"Libre\" sign.

The minimum daytime fare is €4, while at night it rises to €6. Payments are made in cash, and very few taxis accept credit cards. To avoid issues, it's advisable to carry cash up to €20, as taxi drivers are only required to provide change for amounts equal to or less than that. If you call a taxi company, keep in mind that the meter starts running when the taxi receives the call, although the fare is usually reasonable because companies typically send the nearest available taxi to the area of the request.\nBy ride-hailing\n[\nedit\n]\nIn Spain, ride-hailing services are known as \"VTC\" (Vehicle with Driver) services. These services allow users to request private vehicles through mobile apps, such as Uber or Cabify, for trips within the city or to nearby destinations.

Melilla has an extensive network of bike lanes. Drivers are generally accustomed to interacting with cyclists in traffic, though pedestrians occasionally step onto the bike lanes. Cycling on sidewalks without designated bike lanes is not allowed, although this is not strictly enforced. At night, it is necessary to use lights, and it is recommended to wear a reflective vest and helmet.\nBy electric scooter\n[\nedit\n]\nIt is common for bike lanes to be shared with electric mobility vehicles. There are numerous rental shops for electric scooters, as well as repair and spare parts services throughout the city. Unlike bicycles, the local regulations require the use of a helmet when riding electric scooters due to the higher speeds they can reach. It is also prohibited to ride with headphones, whether on a bike or an electric scooter.\nBy tourist train\n[\nedit\n]\nThe city also offers a tourist train, provided by the Tourism Board, which is available to local community groups and cultural organisations in Melilla.\nThe ticket price is subsidised at €3."

Take care when booking from France, as a town named Saint Sébastien exists there as well.\nDonostia/San Sebastian has two main train stations: the\nRENFE\nstation for national and local\nCercanías\ntrains\n43.317738\n-1.976744\n1\nEstación de San Sebastián\n(at the east end of Puente de Maria Cristina), and the\nEuskotren\nAmara\nstation for its local network (at the Plaza Easo).\nFrom\nFrance\n, there is a multitude of TGV and\nTER\n(regional trains) to Hendaye. To reach San Sebastian, change here onto an Euskotren train. Connections are frequent, and continue until late. The last train towards San Sebastian departs Hendaye at 22:33. A few trains from France do not end in Hendaye, and go across the border to Irun. At Irun station, the best option to reach San Sebastian is to change there to a RENFE\nCercanías\ntrain. Direct TGVs from\nParis\nMontparnasse depart at 10:28, 12:28 (to Irun), and 14:28. In addition, there exists a number of possible connections with a change in Bordeaux.\nFrom\nPortugal\n, there is a daily\nTrenhotel\novernight train, leaving\nLisbon\nSta. Appolonia station at 21:18, and arriving San Sebastian at 10:53.\nFrom the major cities of\nSpain\n(outside the Basque Country), the train is much quicker than a bus, and if booked in advance often the cheapest option too. Twice- or thrice-daily direct intercity connections (\nAlvia\n) are maintained by state operator\nRENFE\nfrom\nVitoria-Gasteiz\n,\nBurgos\n,\nValladolid\nand\nMadrid\n, and from\nIruña/Pamplona\n,\nZaragoza\n,\nTarragona\nand\nBarcelona\n. Both lines utilize semi-high speed train sets that travel on the high-speed tracks where they can. Madrid-San Sebastian journey time is between 4 hr 51 min and 5 hr 21min. Barcelona-San Sebastian journey time is 5 hr 39min. RENFE also operates a daily service with conventional coaches (\nArco\n) towards\nSantiago de Compostela\nand\nA Coruña\n, which is ideal for pilgrims looking to skip a portion of the road.\nFrom within the Basque Country (except for Hendaye and Irun), the bus is usually quicker. There are however some scenic train routes operated by\nEuskotren\nfrom the surrounding area, and from Bilbao, with onwards connections by\nCercanías\nfrom\nSantander\n(Cantabria), and\nLeón\n(Castilla y Leon). The routes offer a leisurely alternative to travellers who have time to spare.\nBy plane\n[\nedit\n]\nSan Sebastian is well served by airports:\nSan Sebastian\n, a small airport 20 km from the town centre, next to\nHondarribia\n.\nBus to the airport:\ni2\n(€2.65) departs from Plaza Gipuzkoa nearly once an hour takes 30min, making a maximum of 4 stops (typically less).\nCafes in the departures area are limited to a single cafe on the ground floor, plus posh restaurant on the 2nd floor.\nShopping in departures area is limited to a single souvenir small shop; no duty free shops available.\nWi-Fi network is not available.\nBiarritz\n(in Continental Basque Country, France), 50 km away with\nbus and train connections\nto San Sebastian. Take a French\nSNCF\ntrain to Hendaye, change to the nearby Euskotren station (located just outside the SNCF station) and take a\nEuskotren\nto San Sebastian. Each train ride is between 30–40 minutes, with the total train trip cost less than €10. A coach service also exists between Biarritz airport and the Hendaye train station, via Saint-Jean-De-Luz (change buses there). The coach ride is less than one hour and costs about €4. For an airport transfer, taxi, bus or coach from Biarritz Airport to San Sebastian check\nBiarritz Airport Transfers\nor\nSea-Lifts Airport Transfer\n.\nBilbao airport\nBIO\nIATA\nis 100 km away with good bus connections, about one an hour during the day. The trip takes about 70 min, and costs around €15. The bus company is called PESA. Tickets for the journey from Bilbao to San Sebastian can be purchased on board the bus, however for the trip from San Sebastian to Bilbao, tickets must be purchased from the PESA office around the corner from the bus station.\nVitoria-Gasteiz\nairport\nVIT\nIATA\n114 km from San Sebastian with good bus connections. A bus from the airport will take you to the central bus station, from where you can take a bus (companies\nPesa\nor\nLa Burundesa\n) to San Sebastian for around €7.50.\nBy bus\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Basque Country is generally easier to get around by bus than by train.  Buses arrive and depart at the San Sebastian bus station, at Plaza de Pio XII in Amara Nuevo.  A number of bus companies operate services to San Sebastian, including:\nPesa\nLa Burundesa\nContinental Autos\nATCRB\nRoncalesa\n(for connection with Pamplona).\nBuses are the only way to get to some areas of the Basque region, and often run more often (and cheaper!) than trains.\nVitoria-Gasteiz\n, capital of the Basque Country, is a 2-hour ride away.\nBilbao\n, the travel hub and biggest city in the region (1-hour ride), and\nPamplona\n(1-hour ride) are other popular destinations, but longer-range buses do overnights to\nMadrid\n,\nBarcelona\nand even\nMilan\n.\nBilbao's bus station is accessibly via the San Mamés metro station. Buy a ticket for the next bus to San Sebastian at the Pesa window for\n€17\n. They leave from stop 2, 3, or 4 every 30 minutes or hour.\nBy car\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the downtown, parking is costly (roughly €20/day); most parking spots are underground, and finding a way to get there can be nerve-wracking. Left turns are more rare than rights (and are unpredictable). Having a driving map is essential. The biggest underground parking lots are in the city center, so the easiest way to find a place without wasting time is to go through the road that goes by the river and follow the signs.\nThere are some free parking lots in the west of the city: on the tourist maps by SanSebastianTurismo available in some guesthouses, the area is marked with a blue dotted line \"Controlled parking zone\"."

Still, if you keep some of the local landmarks in mind (church towers and hills are frequently good ones) you can maintain a general sense of direction - which is often all you need to find your way around. Additionally, Granada has several hilly areas (most notably the Albayzin and the entrances to the Alhambra) with many stairways and steep streets, and climbing them can be strenuous - buses can take you to the major tourist sights if the climb is too much. Mind your step in the residential areas! Granada has a serious problem with dog excrement, and while the street sweepers do an effective job they won't save you every time (however this is much less of an issue in the heavily touristy areas).\nBy public transport\n[\nedit\n]\nWith the rechargable green travel card you can use all means of public transport (metro, regional trains, city and regional buses) for a lower price. The card can be bought in tobacco shops for €1.50 and must be charged with at least €5 (Nov 2024). There are other travel cards issued by the metro or the city bus operator, but you can only use certain means of public transport with those cards.\nBy bus\n[\nedit\n]\nThe local Alhambra Buses go where regular buses can't\nThe\nlocal buses\ncover nearly all sights of interest and run quite frequently. Most city buses travel through the heart of town along Gran Vía (stopping in front of the cathedral). The small red and white minibuses with \"Alhambra Bus\" printed on the side are the best way to explore Granada, the Albaicín and to get to the Alhambra: route C30 connects the city center to the Alhambra, with the C31 traveling up to Albayzin and the C34 to the Sacromonte. The buses cost €1.60 per trip (Nov 2024), but you can also buy a multi-trip card for €5, €10, or €20 (€0.83-€0.87 per trip). Timetables for the individual routes are not available, but major bus stops along the main boulevards will have screens telling you when the next bus arrives.  If you're at a smaller stop, you can find out when the next bus is coming by sending a text using the SMS system — directions are printed with images on each bus stop sign, which are easy to follow even if you don't know much Spanish.\nBy metro\n[\nedit\n]\nThere is one metro line. One ticket costs €1.65 (Nov 2024). For multiple rides, consider buying a travel card for €5.30 (Nov 2024).\nBy car\n[\nedit\n]\nDriving in Granada is a nightmare best avoided at all costs. The central district is a mess of narrow, one-way streets and is restricted to buses, taxies, scooters, and tourists with hotel reservations, enforced by a system of traffic cameras that will capture a photo of the license plate and fine violators. Hotels will often recommend not driving in, but if you're insistent you can contact the hotel in advance with your license plate number and they will give you directions to their hotel or a parking garage which you must follow exactly or risk a fine. Outside the historic center streets are wider and travelling by car isn't nearly as much of a hassle, but there are few tourist sights in these areas.\nCheap parking in Granada can be found on parkvia.com. You get a €12 per night rate at Parking HH Maristas in the center of the city as well as unlimited entries to the garage. When you enter, take the ticket from the machine and present it along with the website receipt to the booth attendant."

Take care when booking from France, as a town named Saint Sébastien exists there as well.\nDonostia/San Sebastian has two main train stations: the\nRENFE\nstation for national and local\nCercanías\ntrains\n43.317738\n-1.976744\n1\nEstación de San Sebastián\n(at the east end of Puente de Maria Cristina), and the\nEuskotren\nAmara\nstation for its local network (at the Plaza Easo).\nFrom\nFrance\n, there is a multitude of TGV and\nTER\n(regional trains) to Hendaye. To reach San Sebastian, change here onto an Euskotren train. Connections are frequent, and continue until late. The last train towards San Sebastian departs Hendaye at 22:33. A few trains from France do not end in Hendaye, and go across the border to Irun. At Irun station, the best option to reach San Sebastian is to change there to a RENFE\nCercanías\ntrain. Direct TGVs from\nParis\nMontparnasse depart at 10:28, 12:28 (to Irun), and 14:28. In addition, there exists a number of possible connections with a change in Bordeaux.\nFrom\nPortugal\n, there is a daily\nTrenhotel\novernight train, leaving\nLisbon\nSta. Appolonia station at 21:18, and arriving San Sebastian at 10:53.\nFrom the major cities of\nSpain\n(outside the Basque Country), the train is much quicker than a bus, and if booked in advance often the cheapest option too. Twice- or thrice-daily direct intercity connections (\nAlvia\n) are maintained by state operator\nRENFE\nfrom\nVitoria-Gasteiz\n,\nBurgos\n,\nValladolid\nand\nMadrid\n, and from\nIruña/Pamplona\n,\nZaragoza\n,\nTarragona\nand\nBarcelona\n. Both lines utilize semi-high speed train sets that travel on the high-speed tracks where they can. Madrid-San Sebastian journey time is between 4 hr 51 min and 5 hr 21min. Barcelona-San Sebastian journey time is 5 hr 39min. RENFE also operates a daily service with conventional coaches (\nArco\n) towards\nSantiago de Compostela\nand\nA Coruña\n, which is ideal for pilgrims looking to skip a portion of the road.\nFrom within the Basque Country (except for Hendaye and Irun), the bus is usually quicker. There are however some scenic train routes operated by\nEuskotren\nfrom the surrounding area, and from Bilbao, with onwards connections by\nCercanías\nfrom\nSantander\n(Cantabria), and\nLeón\n(Castilla y Leon). The routes offer a leisurely alternative to travellers who have time to spare."

Their espresso shots are slightly longer than one might expect, but still decent. Make sure to ask about the current coffees when you order, they usually have one darker and one lighter roast.\nAlcohol\n[\nedit\n]\nThe nightlife of Seville is fantastic; no other European city has so many bars per inhabitant than Seville. In summer go to Isla Cartuja and find out why the Spanish night doesn't stop before 07:00. There you can find plenty of open-air discothèques. Other nightlife spots include Calle Betis in Triana, La Alamede de Hércules, and Plaza Alfalfa.\nThere are quite a few teterias in Triana across the river offering teas, shakes and Middle Eastern pastries in a cozy cushion filled environment.\nAcross from the cathedral sits a coffee shop called\nCafe de Indias\nwhere you can buy delicious chocolate shakes and coffees. Down the street is a patisserie shop selling chocolate covered palmeras, a wonderful afternoon treat after a long day touring the sites. There are many coffee shops and patisserie shops in Seville, particularly in Calle Asunción in Los Remedios. Café de Indias, Starbucks and other franchises have descended lately on the city and are a good option in an emergency, but you can get a decent coffee in most local bars. For an up-market classic, visit\nLa Campana\n, at the end of calle Sierpes.\nDon't miss\nCervecería La Internacional\n, one of the best beer shops in Spain. More than 250 types of beer, wonderful tapas and good connections. It's in Calle Barcelona, 1 minute away from Plaza Nueva, near the Town Hall. However, do not get confused, it is international, meaning, not typically Sevillano.\nSangría (an alcoholic fruit punch) is often sought by tourists, but Tinto de Verano (a mix of red wine and lemon or orange soda) is more authentic, has less alcohol, and is often cheaper.\nCruzcampo, the local beer, is worth trying. Compared to other Spaniards, Sevillanos consume more beer and less wine.\nThe tap water in Seville is good.\nAgua de Sevilla is sometimes thought of as a popular drink in Seville, but you will never see a person from Seville drinking it, despite all the tourists drinking it as if it were something popular."

Buses and subways work with the same tickets, and operate within the integrated transit network of\n40.44085\n-3.69998\n1\nCRTM\n(Plaza del Descubridor Diego de Ordás 3, M-F 08:00-20:00).\nA\nsingle ticket\nfor Zone A costs €1.50 (max. 5 stations), but the cost goes up to €2 if you go more than 10 stations, and can be purchased from metro ticket vending machines or directly from the bus driver on entry. A\nten-trip ticket\nMetrobús\n(10 viajes)\ncosts €12.20 (€6.10 until July 2025) for Zone A (no transfers from one mode of transportation to another allowed); these tickets can be shared with other travellers. Children under the age of 4 may travel without a ticket, and children under 11 receive a 50% discount. Tickets can be purchased at metro stations, newsstands, and tobacconists. There are no longer any paper tickets in use in Madrid so, if you do not already have one, you will need to purchase a\nMulti Card\nwhich is a reloadable, contactless card for €2.50 (Jan 2025). It is an anonymous card so can be used for multiple people by passing back the card to the next person in your group. These card support most ticket types except season & concessionary. The Multi Card does not support local rail travel except the tourist tickets.\nIf you plan to use public transport a lot you can purchase a\nTourist Ticket\n[dead link]\n, which allows unlimited travel as well as discounted admission for some tourist attractions. The card can be purchased at any metro station, as well as at the CRTM headquarters. For travel within Zone A the following rates apply: 1 day (€10), 2 days (€17.00), 3 days (€22.50), 5 days (€32.50), or 7 days (€41.00). These tickets are personalised so cannot be shared. They can be used on local rail (Cercanías) in the area of validity.\nIf you're planning on staying for a long time, you might consider investing into the personalised\nTarjeta Transporte Público\n. You can load season tickets onto them according to your age –\nregular\n(adult),\njoven\n(youth) or\nmayor\n(senior). Application must be made in advance at any metro station with a completed application and a copy of your passport. The season tickets can be loaded from any metro vending machine.\nMetro\n[\nedit\n]\nGran Vía\nstation entrance featuring the traditional Metro logo\nThe\nMetro de Madrid\n(Madrid's subway/underground) is one of the best and least expensive metros in Europe. The underground tunnels can provide relief from the sun on hot days.\nTicket machines are multi-lingual with instructions Spanish; you can change the language to English by pressing the circular button with several flags in it. Swiping the smartcard once allows you to use the metro network as long and far as you like – but make sure you stay inside the Metro zone A, as once you leave it you'll have to swipe your smartcard again. If you are travelling in the city centre, then multiple people can tap in using the same Multi card; they don’t have to buy their own individual card. However, some outlying stations as well as airport stations have another check at the exit where you have to \"tap out\" because the fare from central Madrid is higher. Should you go there more than once, buy the \"ten trip all network\" ticket (which is slightly more expensive than the \"ten trip central area\" ticket) or a day ticket. When you travel to/from airport stations, there is additional supplement of €3, which can be paid at the entrance or exit. The tourist tickets do not require this supplement as it is included in the price.\nGenerally the Metro operates daily from 06:00-01:30, although you can catch some trains as late as 02:00. Frequencies range from 2-4 minutes during rush hour to up to 15 minutes from midnight onwards.\nBicycles\nare permitted on the Metro during most periods except during rush hour, generally M-F 07:30-09:30, 14:00-16:00, and 18:00-20:00.\nPets in carriers\nand dogs are also permitted.\nPickpockets are rife on the metro, and travellers should take appropriate precautions. Announcements in Metro trains and stations are made mostly in Spanish only, though some signs are bilingual in Spanish and English.\nBus\n[\nedit\n]\nEMT Madrid bus\nWhatever the Metro doesn't cover,\nEMT\nbuses do. Generally buses run 06:00-24:00.\nBúho\n(\nowl\n) night buses have their main hub at\n40.41898\n-3.69327\n2\nPlaza de Cibeles\n, covering most of the city at roughly 20-minute intervals.\nAll buses are equipped with free Wi-Fi facility (EMTmadrid), easy to use with any type of laptop or mobile device. For travellers with smartphones, there is a helpful official EMT app for iPhone and Android with a route planner and schedules.\nTrain\n[\nedit\n]\nMadrid has a system of local trains called\nCercanías\nthat connects outlying suburbs and villages with the city centre. Although most useful for visiting historic or outdoor destinations outside the city core, it is also useful for quickly getting from one end of the city to another, as well as to\n40.4913\n-3.592\n3\nTerminal T4\nof Barajas airport. If you are flying from another terminal; there is a free inter terminal bus but you will have to allow extra time to use it. You also avoid the airport the metro €3 surcharge and can be much faster than the metro. Tickets are purchased on an individual basis priced according to the number of Cercanías zones you are travelling through but on the ticket machine you select the station you are travelling to. Tickets are issued on a reuseable\n+Renfe & Tú\ncard for which there is a €0.50 charge with your first purchase. There is a separate line\nmap\nbut it does indicate the metro interchange stations.\n40.47203\n-3.6817\n4\nChamartín Cercanías\nand\n40.4466\n-3.69216\n5\nEstación de Nuevos Ministerios\nare in the north, and\n40.41693\n-3.70347\n6\nEstación de Sol\nin the centre and\n40.4053\n-3.688\n7\nAtoche Cercanías\nis in the south of the city.\nBy taxi\n[\nedit\n]\nTaxis in Madrid\nAlongside its metro system, Madrid boasts one of Europe's largest taxi fleets. Taxis are usually plentiful and easy to find, but they become harder to find during late hours on weekends, especially if there is some rain. Unlike in other European cities, there are few taxi stands; just stand by the side of a major road or bus stop and wave your hand to signal an available taxi passing by. Available taxis have a green\nlibre\nsign in the windshield and a green light on top.\nOfficial taxis are white, and have a red stripe and the flag of Madrid on the front door. The tariff is displayed on top of the car – a\n1\nduring daytime and a\n2\nat night, which become\n2\nand\n3\non public holidays such as Christmas Eve.\nSome taxi drivers will do what is called\nla vuelta al ruedo\n— they will drive you around or through the crowded avenues to increase the fare.\nMost taxi drivers do not speak fluent English, so you should have the names and addresses of your destinations written in Spanish to show your taxi driver. Likewise, get your hotel's business card in case you get lost. When giving an address to a taxi driver, it is useful to say the name of the neighbourhood in addition to the street name and number, for example: Calle de Don Ramón de la Cruz, 74, Lista. Another option is to use an app like\nFree Now\nor\nPideTaxi\n, where you can enter your destination and the app will hail a taxi for you.\nFor those looking for alternatives to a taxi, rideshare services\nBolt\n,\nCabify\nand\nUber\nalso operate throughout the city.\nBy car\n[\nedit\n]\nCars have been one of the most hot button issues in Madrid municipal politics in the twenty first century. Leftist mayor Manuela Carmena introduced a scheme to drastically reduce the number of cars in central Madrid, however she lost reelection in 2019 and the new right-wing Mayor José Luis Martínez-Almeida reversed course before being forced by European Union legislation they had violated to partially reinstate the ban. In short: driving a car in Madrid can be a nightmare, but not as bad as cities like Paris or Brussels. Parts of the Spanish capital's downtown suffers from the typical problems of most big cities: far too many cars and not enough space to accommodate them. However, you can often see construction works on roads aimed at finding a better balance between cars and buses, and evidence is pointing towards easier coexistence between all modes of transportation. With that said, traffic jams in major arteries like the\nPaseo de la Castellana\ncan occur deep into the night. The problem is compounded by the narrow streets in the old town, where a lorry delivering beer barrels to a local bar can cause a huge tailback. Finding a parking space can be very time consuming, and difficult if one is not skilled in the art of close proximity parallel parking. Many Spaniards are also lacking in this art, prompting them to simply park in the street, blocking other cars in. If you find yourself blocked in by such a practice, honk your horn until the driver returns. Most Madrileños park by sound alone: they will feel no remorse for repeatedly hitting the car in front and behind them while trying to get into or out of a tight spot. If you value your car's paint job, or you have rented a car, it may be best to park underground. Though this is no guarantee for nobody hitting your car, the chances are somewhat diminished.\nFor free parking but within walking distance of 20 minutes to Sol, try the street at\nPrincipe Pio\nmetro stop. The place to park is the street near to the shopping mall called 'Calle de Mozart'. It is packed with cars on weekday mornings because of people getting to the Metro station. During the evenings and weekends it's easy to get a parking spot.\nRenting a car is not recommended for getting around central Madrid, and if you're only staying within this area a car is likely to be more of a liability than an asset. Visitors should make use of Madrid's excellent public transportation instead. Renting a car however makes sense if you are planning to leave central Madrid to venture into the outer districts or to nearby towns. Car rental facilities are available at the airport, train stations, and other main travel sites, and cars from car-sharing services like\nFree2move\n,\nGoTo\n[dead link]\n,\nVoltio\n,\nWiBLE\nand\nZity\nare widely available on the street to rent on a per-minute basis. Always be sure to have a street map handy! The roads within Madrid are difficult to navigate as there are no places to stop and consult a map or check your route.\nThere are several consecutive junctions underground near the centre and your GPS may not get a signal underground. Plan your turns before you enter the tunnels.\nBy bicycle\n[\nedit\n]\nMadrid Río\nMadrid does not appear as a\nbike-friendly\ncity at a first sight. Things were changing slowly to make bike experience more comfortable, but in 2019 the new right-wing mayor planned to make the city the only capital in the world where bicycle lanes are being removed. Several streets in the city centre have been transformed into mixed-traffic spaces where pedestrians and bikes have priority over cars. There are new easy-bike paths all along the river and connecting important parks.\nIt is also possible to use a lot of narrow easy streets where traffic is slow and calm to travel along the city without depending on exclusive bike paths. There are some official and unofficial publications with these streets along the web.\nTo avoid some of Madrid inconveniencies, such as hot weather or slopy streets it is also possible to get bikes on Metro and Railways trains with some schedule restrictions, and on every public transport without restrictions when using folding-bikes.\nMadrid's public bike rental service, called\nBiciMAD\n. It boasts 1560 electric bikes spread over 123 stations. Unfortunately, the site is not yet available in English. However, the information at the bike stations is available in multiple languages. A casual user pays no initial fee, but €2 for every first hour or fraction, and €4 for the second (Oct 2019). A contactless card is issued instantaneously upon signing up at any bike station. The process is relatively quick and requires some basic information such as name, ID, email and credit card number. Swipe the card through the somewhat larger opening on the left of any bike to retrieve it. Use the buttons to the left of the handlebar to toggle electric assistance. Here you'll also find a button to switch on the lights. So watch out, you'll need to do this yourself when it gets dark! Be equally careful when using electric assistance for the first time, as it might require some getting used to.\nThere are also some rent shops in the historical centre area such as the company\nBaja Bikes Madrid\n. This company offers several rental points in Madrid at Retiro, Atocha, Madrid-Río, etc. They offer guided and self-guided bicycle tours, using electric or conventional bicycles.\n40.41887\n-3.70076\n1\nTrixi bike tours\n,\nc/Jardines 12\n,\n☏\n+34 915 231 547\n.\nBicycle tours and rental from €4/hr.

Buses and subways work with the same tickets, and operate within the integrated transit network of\n40.44085\n-3.69998\n1\nCRTM\n(Plaza del Descubridor Diego de Ordás 3, M-F 08:00-20:00).\nA\nsingle ticket\nfor Zone A costs €1.50 (max. 5 stations), but the cost goes up to €2 if you go more than 10 stations, and can be purchased from metro ticket vending machines or directly from the bus driver on entry. A\nten-trip ticket\nMetrobús\n(10 viajes)\ncosts €12.20 (€6.10 until July 2025) for Zone A (no transfers from one mode of transportation to another allowed); these tickets can be shared with other travellers. Children under the age of 4 may travel without a ticket, and children under 11 receive a 50% discount. Tickets can be purchased at metro stations, newsstands, and tobacconists. There are no longer any paper tickets in use in Madrid so, if you do not already have one, you will need to purchase a\nMulti Card\nwhich is a reloadable, contactless card for €2.50 (Jan 2025). It is an anonymous card so can be used for multiple people by passing back the card to the next person in your group. These card support most ticket types except season & concessionary. The Multi Card does not support local rail travel except the tourist tickets.\nIf you plan to use public transport a lot you can purchase a\nTourist Ticket\n[dead link]\n, which allows unlimited travel as well as discounted admission for some tourist attractions. The card can be purchased at any metro station, as well as at the CRTM headquarters. For travel within Zone A the following rates apply: 1 day (€10), 2 days (€17.00), 3 days (€22.50), 5 days (€32.50), or 7 days (€41.00). These tickets are personalised so cannot be shared. They can be used on local rail (Cercanías) in the area of validity.\nIf you're planning on staying for a long time, you might consider investing into the personalised\nTarjeta Transporte Público\n. You can load season tickets onto them according to your age –\nregular\n(adult),\njoven\n(youth) or\nmayor\n(senior). Application must be made in advance at any metro station with a completed application and a copy of your passport. The season tickets can be loaded from any metro vending machine.\nMetro\n[\nedit\n]\nGran Vía\nstation entrance featuring the traditional Metro logo\nThe\nMetro de Madrid\n(Madrid's subway/underground) is one of the best and least expensive metros in Europe. The underground tunnels can provide relief from the sun on hot days.\nTicket machines are multi-lingual with instructions Spanish; you can change the language to English by pressing the circular button with several flags in it. Swiping the smartcard once allows you to use the metro network as long and far as you like – but make sure you stay inside the Metro zone A, as once you leave it you'll have to swipe your smartcard again. If you are travelling in the city centre, then multiple people can tap in using the same Multi card; they don’t have to buy their own individual card. However, some outlying stations as well as airport stations have another check at the exit where you have to \"tap out\" because the fare from central Madrid is higher. Should you go there more than once, buy the \"ten trip all network\" ticket (which is slightly more expensive than the \"ten trip central area\" ticket) or a day ticket. When you travel to/from airport stations, there is additional supplement of €3, which can be paid at the entrance or exit. The tourist tickets do not require this supplement as it is included in the price.\nGenerally the Metro operates daily from 06:00-01:30, although you can catch some trains as late as 02:00. Frequencies range from 2-4 minutes during rush hour to up to 15 minutes from midnight onwards.\nBicycles\nare permitted on the Metro during most periods except during rush hour, generally M-F 07:30-09:30, 14:00-16:00, and 18:00-20:00.\nPets in carriers\nand dogs are also permitted.\nPickpockets are rife on the metro, and travellers should take appropriate precautions. Announcements in Metro trains and stations are made mostly in Spanish only, though some signs are bilingual in Spanish and English.\nBus\n[\nedit\n]\nEMT Madrid bus\nWhatever the Metro doesn't cover,\nEMT\nbuses do. Generally buses run 06:00-24:00.\nBúho\n(\nowl\n) night buses have their main hub at\n40.41898\n-3.69327\n2\nPlaza de Cibeles\n, covering most of the city at roughly 20-minute intervals.\nAll buses are equipped with free Wi-Fi facility (EMTmadrid), easy to use with any type of laptop or mobile device. For travellers with smartphones, there is a helpful official EMT app for iPhone and Android with a route planner and schedules.\nTrain\n[\nedit\n]\nMadrid has a system of local trains called\nCercanías\nthat connects outlying suburbs and villages with the city centre. Although most useful for visiting historic or outdoor destinations outside the city core, it is also useful for quickly getting from one end of the city to another, as well as to\n40.4913\n-3.592\n3\nTerminal T4\nof Barajas airport. If you are flying from another terminal; there is a free inter terminal bus but you will have to allow extra time to use it. You also avoid the airport the metro €3 surcharge and can be much faster than the metro. Tickets are purchased on an individual basis priced according to the number of Cercanías zones you are travelling through but on the ticket machine you select the station you are travelling to. Tickets are issued on a reuseable\n+Renfe & Tú\ncard for which there is a €0.50 charge with your first purchase. There is a separate line\nmap\nbut it does indicate the metro interchange stations.\n40.47203\n-3.6817\n4\nChamartín Cercanías\nand\n40.4466\n-3.69216\n5\nEstación de Nuevos Ministerios\nare in the north, and\n40.41693\n-3.70347\n6\nEstación de Sol\nin the centre and\n40.4053\n-3.688\n7\nAtoche Cercanías\nis in the south of the city."

As a result, it's best to rent a car (see\n'Get around'\n) and get out to explore some of the great beaches, or else you will be fighting for space. Moreover, the larger family resorts have beaches that, again, do fill up quickly, so go and explore some of the more obscure beaches listed below.\nMenorca has its share of beautiful coastline that deserves recognition.\nNon-resort\nMenorcan beaches are generally not crowded, so finding a nice relaxing spot of your own is not hard to achieve, provided you have access to a car or scooter.\nEs Grau is a great, long beach north of\nMaó\nwith shallow water ideal for families that is very close to a nature reserve that has some great walks.\nPunta Prima Beach\n, southeast of Maó, is a relatively small beach with some great facilities in Punta Prima.\nCala Macarella\n, west of\nCala Galdana\n, is undoubtedly one of the best beaches on Menorca, with crystal clear blue waters, a brilliant natural cove and a small cafe/bar.\nCala en Turqueta\nalso west of Cala Galdana, is a brilliant beach with great soft sand and the same turquoise water (where it gets its name from) as Macarella.\n40.056562\n4.040672\n1\nCala Pregonda\n,\nSon Ametller\n07740 Es Mercadal\n(\naccess is via a long road up from Es Mercadal town\n).\nPregonda is a medium-sized beach on the north side of Menorca with golden fine sand. It has clear, blue, inviting water, and is unparalleled on Menorca, with its island in the middle of the bay that is definitely worth a climb, and the golden rocky sea beds behind the island. There is a smaller, quieter sister beach to the east of Pregonda called Pregondó.\nFree\n.\n(\nupdated Jun 2018\n)\n39.871503\n4.132129\n2\nCala en Porter\n,\nPlatja de Cala en Porter, 07730 Cala en Porter\n(\nhead down the ME-12, then follow signs for the beach; there's a car park at the beach\n).\n24 hr\n.\nCala en Porter is possibly one of the best beaches for families, with a playground, great sand and shallow water. The beach itself is stunning too, being at the end of a great bay surrounded by cliffs, with pedalo hire and sunbed hire. Gets busy but it's a wide beach, so there's plenty of space for everyone. Popular with families.\nFree\n.\n(\nupdated Jun 2018\n)\nAt\nSon Bou\n, the longest beach on Menorca means there's plenty of space for everyone if you don't mind walking a few minutes from the crowd. Pale sand and loads of room make this beach great for kids: sunbeds and pedalos are available at the resort end of the beach. Brilliant for families.\n39.916621\n4.034185\n3\nSanto Tomas\n(\nPlaya San Adeodato, Binigaus\n),\nUrbanizacion Santo Tomas, 07749 Menorca\n(\nhead down the ME-18 from Es Migjorn Gran, then turn right just before the mini-roundabout at the bottom of the road to enter a large car park perfect for the beaches\n).\nSanto Tomas has three very long beaches; the first, Playa de Santo Tomas, is a long winding strip of sand near the resorts' hotels, and so is popular with families. San Adeodato, west from Playa de Santo Tomas, is thinner and strewn with pebbles with a shallow shore, ideal for sun-worshippers and those looking to spend a few hours there. The third, Binigaus, is further west still, and is only accessible by a long path from the west of Santo Tomas. As a result, it is not suitable for those with young children and so is a brilliant spacious beach for adults looking to unwind away from the noise.\n(\nupdated Jul 2018\n)"

In summer go to Isla Cartuja and find out why the Spanish night doesn't stop before 07:00. There you can find plenty of open-air discothèques. Other nightlife spots include Calle Betis in Triana, La Alamede de Hércules, and Plaza Alfalfa.\nThere are quite a few teterias in Triana across the river offering teas, shakes and Middle Eastern pastries in a cozy cushion filled environment.\nAcross from the cathedral sits a coffee shop called\nCafe de Indias\nwhere you can buy delicious chocolate shakes and coffees. Down the street is a patisserie shop selling chocolate covered palmeras, a wonderful afternoon treat after a long day touring the sites. There are many coffee shops and patisserie shops in Seville, particularly in Calle Asunción in Los Remedios. Café de Indias, Starbucks and other franchises have descended lately on the city and are a good option in an emergency, but you can get a decent coffee in most local bars. For an up-market classic, visit\nLa Campana\n, at the end of calle Sierpes.\nDon't miss\nCervecería La Internacional\n, one of the best beer shops in Spain. More than 250 types of beer, wonderful tapas and good connections. It's in Calle Barcelona, 1 minute away from Plaza Nueva, near the Town Hall. However, do not get confused, it is international, meaning, not typically Sevillano.\nSangría (an alcoholic fruit punch) is often sought by tourists, but Tinto de Verano (a mix of red wine and lemon or orange soda) is more authentic, has less alcohol, and is often cheaper.\nCruzcampo, the local beer, is worth trying. Compared to other Spaniards, Sevillanos consume more beer and less wine.\nThe tap water in Seville is good.\nAgua de Sevilla is sometimes thought of as a popular drink in Seville, but you will never see a person from Seville drinking it, despite all the tourists drinking it as if it were something popular."

Many shops in Toledo sell decorated plates, shields, spoons and key rings.\nSwords\n– Toledo is well known for its swords, so be sure to look for a conquistador sword, which should set you back around US$300. As you can't bring it on a plane, or even on a train, you'll need to send it. Many shops will ship it for you for a reasonable price.\nCeramics\n– Talavera de la Reina (outside of Toledo) has a centuries-old tradition of glazed ceramics. Toledo is filled with handpainted ceramics of varying degrees of quality (upscale shops and boutiques are pricier, but generally carry higher-quality pieces).\nDamascene\n– Another famous handicraft of Toledo is damascene, from the ancient Moorish art of interlacing gold on iron or steel, then firing it so the underlying material oxidizes and becomes black, with the gold in sharp relief. Every shop in Toledo will carry some form of damascene work, most frequently as small decorative plates and jewellery. Damascene also tends to be on the expensive side, so be sure to comparison-shop around Toledo.

The central district is a mess of narrow, one-way streets and is restricted to buses, taxies, scooters, and tourists with hotel reservations, enforced by a system of traffic cameras that will capture a photo of the license plate and fine violators. Hotels will often recommend not driving in, but if you're insistent you can contact the hotel in advance with your license plate number and they will give you directions to their hotel or a parking garage which you must follow exactly or risk a fine. Outside the historic center streets are wider and travelling by car isn't nearly as much of a hassle, but there are few tourist sights in these areas.\nCheap parking in Granada can be found on parkvia.com. You get a €12 per night rate at Parking HH Maristas in the center of the city as well as unlimited entries to the garage. When you enter, take the ticket from the machine and present it along with the website receipt to the booth attendant."

    "text": "Understand\n[\nedit\n]\nWith no airport and a population of just over 12,000 (2019), Formentera is usually quieter than its neighbour\nIbiza\n. However, in the peak season of July-August, it draws huge numbers of tourists. The overwhelming majority are\nItalian\nand the\nItalian language\nis heard more often than any other. Some are independent travellers, but many come on package holidays. In peak season, advance booking for hotels is absolutely essential. The\nhotels\non the island are mostly small and independently owned. The majority are in the one- and two-star categories. There are also many small apartment developments. There are no high-rise buildings on Formentera.\nCamping\nis forbidden on the island.\nIt has very few cultural or historical attractions such as museums, castles, churches or art galleries. Its cultural attractions include some megalithic sites, a Roman road, some watch towers (18th century), the 18th-century chapel of Sant Francesc Xavier and a small Ethnological museum.\nSome of the islanders make their living from small-scale traditional fishing. In parts of the island, the soil is good enough to support vines and fruit trees. Several parts of the island are covered in Mediterranean pine trees. Salt marshes (now abandoned) are defining features of parts of the island. However, tourism is the biggest sector of the local economy.\nOutside the peak season when the tourists are not mainly high spenders, Formentera has an atmosphere of simplicity and back-to-nature that is the heritage of its past hippie phase. More and more, parts of the island are actively managed as a national park with, for example, boardwalks through the sand dunes to enable them to regenerate their vegetation. In addition, areas of the surrounding seas are designated as zones of particular scientific interest in which certain plant and fish species are protected.\nThe public authorities pursue a policy of responsible, sustainable tourism. It is questionable whether the saturation of tourists in the peak weeks of July and August is compatible with such a policy although, in reality, the revenues from this period are very important for the local economy.\n38.73431\n1.416021\n1\nMunicipal Tourist Information Office Formentera\n,\nLa Savina - Formentera, c / Calpe, s/n, Formentera\n,\n☏\n+34 971 322 057\n.\n(\nupdated Sep 2015\n)"

Departures don't usually coincide with the ferry arrival times.\nJourney time to\nValle Gran Rey\nis around 1 hr 45 min. These buses are popular and it isn't always possible to get on especially at the port when boats come in. Buses returning to the tourist centres late in the afternoon tend to get full of walkers and likewise the ones heading into the mountains early in the mornings. Fares vary by distance, but are very reasonable. Drivers do not like to pick up or set down between stops for tourists even though you may see them do it for elderly locals. The public buses are a blue/turquoise colour and are run by Servicio Regular Gomera S.L. Tickets are purchased from the driver. There are many other private coaches darting about the island which will not stop for you. The timetables do change and tourist offices will have up-to-date versions. A reliable source should be the\nofficial website\n[dead link]\n.\nBy car\n[\nedit\n]\nReputable car hire companies include\nCICAR\nor\ngomerarentacar.com\n. One of the companies that accept debit cards is\nPluscar\n. Most companies have their office right next to the San Sebastian ferry terminal. Since the number of cars at the pier is limited (compared to, e.g., TFS airport), it's probably best to book upfront.\nPetrol is relatively cheap - about 1/10 less than in mainland Spain. However, bear in mind that the roads are very winding indeed, so driving is slow - don't expect to go faster than 50 km/h most of the time. For example, air distance is only about 22 km across the island from San Sebastian to Valle Gran Rey, but the distance by road is over twice that, and it will take you an hour and a half to drive it. Many people combine walking with hitchhiking. Taxis are not prohibitively expensive especially if there are several of you sharing.\nOn foot\n[\nedit\n]\nThe preferred method for a lot of people coming here—see\n#Hiking\nbelow."

Avoid the San Francisco area, however. Violent crime is extremely rare, but the usual precautions will keep you out of trouble.\nWhile some may advise you not to wear any Spanish symbols, the reality is that the vast majority of Bilbainos will not even notice, much as it is true that a small minority might be upset about them. As a statistical precaution it is also best to avoid referring to the Basque Country as Spain.\nInhabitants of the Basque Country are divided between those who support independence or autonomy from Spain and consider themselves primarily or entirely Basque and others who consider themselves primarily or entirely Spanish. Within these currents, there are further subdivisions of opinion ranging from supporters of the terrorist group ETA (officially disbanded in 2018) at one end to those who supported the fascist regime of General Franco at the other (though an overwhelming majority of people fall somewhere in between these extremes).\nThese political issues have dominated life in the Basque Country for generations and you will still find coverage of them in news media across the Basque Country every day. Also certain bars will have a distinctly Basque nationalist clientele (such bars will generally have posters and slogans on the walls) where pro-Spanish opinions will be unwelcome, but which are otherwise perfectly safe places to go and indeed interesting to anyone who would like to learn more about the Basque identity. If speaking to strangers, bear these divisions in mind and try not to cause offence."

If your accommodation is on Rambla, El Born is a great place to enjoy a more relaxed atmosphere, and find more creative shops and craftsmen.

Many people combine walking with hitchhiking. Taxis are not prohibitively expensive especially if there are several of you sharing."

In the summer months there are direct ferries between Denia and Formentera.\nAlternatively, you can fly to Ibiza and Formentera can be reached by regular ferries from the Estacion Maritima in\nIbiza Town\nand by tourist ferries from other parts of Ibiza during high season. If you're traveling Ibiza by car, check out the stop at Playa d'en Bossa which has a free public parking place right next to it (€20 for a return trip that takes about 60 minutes each way). The boat from Ibiza (Eivissa) to Formentera takes around half an hour, and leaves every half hour in the summer. The boat trip costs €17-24 per person for a single trip. You can buy the ticket on the boat, and you do not need to reserve, but if you want to take a car it is best to reserve during the high season.\nNext to the standard ferry there is a yellow speedboat ferry for around €30 per person for a return trip. The speedboat starts from the beach of Platja d'en Bossa near Figueretes."

Taxis are usually plentiful and easy to find, but they become harder to find during late hours on weekends, especially if there is some rain. Unlike in other European cities, there are few taxi stands; just stand by the side of a major road or bus stop and wave your hand to signal an available taxi passing by. Available taxis have a green\nlibre\nsign in the windshield and a green light on top.\nOfficial taxis are white, and have a red stripe and the flag of Madrid on the front door. The tariff is displayed on top of the car – a\n1\nduring daytime and a\n2\nat night, which become\n2\nand\n3\non public holidays such as Christmas Eve.\nSome taxi drivers will do what is called\nla vuelta al ruedo\n— they will drive you around or through the crowded avenues to increase the fare.\nMost taxi drivers do not speak fluent English, so you should have the names and addresses of your destinations written in Spanish to show your taxi driver. Likewise, get your hotel's business card in case you get lost. When giving an address to a taxi driver, it is useful to say the name of the neighbourhood in addition to the street name and number, for example: Calle de Don Ramón de la Cruz, 74, Lista. Another option is to use an app like\nFree Now\nor\nPideTaxi\n, where you can enter your destination and the app will hail a taxi for you.\nFor those looking for alternatives to a taxi, rideshare services\nBolt\n,\nCabify\nand\nUber\nalso operate throughout the city."

For a drink with a waterside view, head to the waterfront which is where the majority of bars are situated.\nMenorcan Gin\nOn Menorca there were a great many junipers, (there still are), and in the harbour lay the British fleet. The twain met and Ginet was the result, a spirit far removed from the Spanish and Mediterranean traditions and with notable difference from the English Gin.\nIt is a kind of cross between London Gin and the Mediterranean spirit, invented in Menorca. It was very successful and was drunk throughout the British Fleet and it surprised more than one distinguished visitor to declare \"the best of the sprits found in Europe today\" was historian Vargas Ponce's opinion on visiting Menorca in 1781.\nThe major difference between London Gin and Menorcan Ginet, is that Menorcan Ginet is based on a spirit distilled from the grape, as is usual in the Mediterranean, and not on a cereal based spirit. The juniper now comes from the mainland, but the distilling continues to be done in old copper stills. The spirit rests in oak barrels cured in gin so that the end product does not take the colour of the wood.\nGin is found all over Menorca, drunk neat or in a mix.  One such mix, named Pomada, is created by adding bitter lemon.  It's the drink of choice during the many fiestas which take place throughout the summer on the island.\nYou can find information about how to visit the distillery shop in the\nMaó\narticle."

    "text": "By car\n[\nedit\n]\nCars have been one of the most hot button issues in Madrid municipal politics in the twenty first century. Leftist mayor Manuela Carmena introduced a scheme to drastically reduce the number of cars in central Madrid, however she lost reelection in 2019 and the new right-wing Mayor José Luis Martínez-Almeida reversed course before being forced by European Union legislation they had violated to partially reinstate the ban. In short: driving a car in Madrid can be a nightmare, but not as bad as cities like Paris or Brussels. Parts of the Spanish capital's downtown suffers from the typical problems of most big cities: far too many cars and not enough space to accommodate them. However, you can often see construction works on roads aimed at finding a better balance between cars and buses, and evidence is pointing towards easier coexistence between all modes of transportation. With that said, traffic jams in major arteries like the\nPaseo de la Castellana\ncan occur deep into the night. The problem is compounded by the narrow streets in the old town, where a lorry delivering beer barrels to a local bar can cause a huge tailback. Finding a parking space can be very time consuming, and difficult if one is not skilled in the art of close proximity parallel parking. Many Spaniards are also lacking in this art, prompting them to simply park in the street, blocking other cars in. If you find yourself blocked in by such a practice, honk your horn until the driver returns. Most Madrileños park by sound alone: they will feel no remorse for repeatedly hitting the car in front and behind them while trying to get into or out of a tight spot. If you value your car's paint job, or you have rented a car, it may be best to park underground. Though this is no guarantee for nobody hitting your car, the chances are somewhat diminished.\nFor free parking but within walking distance of 20 minutes to Sol, try the street at\nPrincipe Pio\nmetro stop. The place to park is the street near to the shopping mall called 'Calle de Mozart'. It is packed with cars on weekday mornings because of people getting to the Metro station. During the evenings and weekends it's easy to get a parking spot.\nRenting a car is not recommended for getting around central Madrid, and if you're only staying within this area a car is likely to be more of a liability than an asset. Visitors should make use of Madrid's excellent public transportation instead. Renting a car however makes sense if you are planning to leave central Madrid to venture into the outer districts or to nearby towns. Car rental facilities are available at the airport, train stations, and other main travel sites, and cars from car-sharing services like\nFree2move\n,\nGoTo\n[dead link]\n,\nVoltio\n,\nWiBLE\nand\nZity\nare widely available on the street to rent on a per-minute basis. Always be sure to have a street map handy! The roads within Madrid are difficult to navigate as there are no places to stop and consult a map or check your route.\nThere are several consecutive junctions underground near the centre and your GPS may not get a signal underground. Plan your turns before you enter the tunnels."

Constructed after the Reconquista of Granada to replace the mosque on the site, the cathedral was laid out with Gothic foundations but built in the Renaissance style and decorated with Baroque elements. Upon entering you'll be behind the main altar, located beneath the towering circular\nCapilla Mayor\n(sanctuary) with its magnificent domed ceiling. Surrounding the sanctuary and the pews are a series of chapels with magnificent artwork, and the sacristy (tucked away on your right immediately after entering) holds a collection of fine paintings, mirrors, and furnishings.

The chapel was constructed in Gothic style but the intricate marble tombs are done in Renaissance style. Additionally, Ferdinand and Isabella's heirs Juana I (\nJuana la Loca\n) and Philip I (\nFelipe el Hermoso\n) are buried here. Aside from the beautiful and intricate artwork in the chapel and high altar there is also a museum on-site with a number of objects symbolizing Ferdinand and Isabel's rule, including Isabella's art collection, crown and sceptre and Ferdinand's sword.\nAdults €5, under 12 free, students €3.50\n.\n(\nupdated May 2023\n)\n37.175278\n-3.6\n4\nPlaza de Bib-Rambla\n,\na block west of the Cathedral\n.\nA pleasant square with a view of the cathedral's tower, this plaza was originally the center of Moorish Granada, a bustling focus point of markets and festivals.

Although the market initially survived the Reconquista, Philip II had it shut down and a fire destroyed what was left in 1850. Today's market was rebuilt in the late 19th century for tourists and holds mostly souvenir stores underneath the Moorish-style archways decorating the walls.

The last Moorish stronghold in Europe, the Alhambra reflects the splendor of Moorish civilization in Andalusia and offers the visitor splendid ornamental architecture, spectacular and lush gardens, cascading and dripping water features, and breathtaking views of the city. This impressive fortress complex is deservedly listed as a\nUNESCO World Heritage site\n.\nThe Alhambra was a palace, citadel, fortress and the home of the Nasrid sultans, high government officials, servants of the court and elite soldiers from the 13th to the 14th century. Other notable buildings belonging to a different time period are also located within the Alhambra complex, most notably the Renaissance style Palace of Charles V, which houses the Alhambra Museum (with historical artifacts from the site) and the Fine Art Museum.\nBut in order to fully appreciate the unique architecture of the Alhambra set within the surrounding landscape, it is advisable to see the Alhambra for afar as well as up close: several locations in the Albaizín (most notably the San Nicolás Viewpoint) or Sacromonte, both covered below, allow you the opportunity to truly admire the Alhambra's spectacular location, lying just above the city of Granada.\nThe Alhambra is a vast complex, composed of many structures and gardens on its lush grounds, which alone are worth exploring; it is free to do so and they are open nearly all hours of the day. There are four primary attractions: the Alcazaba, the Palace of Charles V, the Palacios Nazaries and the Generalife.\nOfficial web site at\nwww.alhambra-patronato.es\n[dead link]\n, where you can buy tickets online. Mar-Oct every day 8:30-22:00 plus F/Sa 22:00-23:30; Oct-Mar every day 8:30-18:00 plus F/Sa 20:00-21:30 (\nticket office closes one hour before attraction, evening visits to Palacios Nazaries only\n). €14 combo ticket for Palacios Nazaries, Alcazaba and Generalife, €7 for just the Alcazaba and Generalife, €8 for an evening visit to the Palacios Nazaries, and €5 for an evening visit to the Generalife. Palace of Charles V free.\nReservations:\nIt is strongly recommended that you book tickets to the Alhambra in advance, as the number of visitors allowed inside the Palacios Nazaries is limited and tickets tend to sell out. These can be booked\nonline via the official website\n, by phone (\n+34\n902 888 001), or in person at the main entrance to the Alhambra or at the Tienda de la Alhambra shop on Calle Reyes Católicos in the city centre. Note that the online and phone reservation services require a credit card (which you must bring with you to the Alhambra ticket office to pick up your tickets) and charge an extra 10% fee on top of the cost of admission. Online tickets are usually sold out many days or even months in advance, but every day more tickets are put on sale: that means you can get an online ticket by checking the website daily, the refresh happens at midnight. Several hundred tickets are reserved for sale on the day but these usually require arriving early and queuing for an hour or two. As of September 2023, it's been reported that no tickets are available to purchase on site when they are sold out on the official website. The \"Granada Card\" or \"Doble de Oro General\" can still be available after the regular tickets have sold out. Failing that, quite a lot of the grounds are accessible without a ticket. This general caution applies to cruise ship land tours (e.g., from Malaga); failure to book Alhambra tours early (before or during cruise) may mean no tours or buses are available.\nNote that the Palacios Nazaries can only be accessed for a half-hour time window (shown on the ticket) within your visiting period. The rest of the Alhambra can be visited the full day without any time restrictions.\nGetting there:\nFrom central Granada, the C3 bus offers a direct connection to the Alhambra from Plaza Isabel La Catolica. There are three stops for the Alhambra:\nGeneralife\n(closest to the ticket office),\nCarlos V\n(closest to the Palace of Charles V) and\nPuerta de la Justica\n, the fare is €1.40. A taxi from the central district (head to the stand on Plaza Nueva) costs around €6. On foot, you can walk up to the Alhambra from Plaza Nueva (about a 30-minute hike) by taking Cuesta de Gomerez and heading straight; the ticket office is on the far side of the grounds, near the Generalife. If coming by car from outside the city, you can bypass the historic district by taking the Ronda Sur-Alhambra exit (A-395) from the highway and following the signs to the parking lot (€1.75/hour).\n37.17708\n-3.59176\n10\nAlcazaba\n. The ruins of a massive fortress perched atop the crest of the hill overlooking the city, this is the oldest part of the Alhambra and offers some of the finest views of anywhere in the complex, with an expansive panorama from the top of the prominent tower that gives you a spectacular view of nearly the entire city and the Sierra Nevada mountains. Within the fort's walls are the ruins of a town which once held soldier's homes and baths, though today only the outline of these rooms remain.\n37.17678\n-3.5899\n11\nPalace of Charles V\n(\nPalacio de Carlos V\n). A more recent addition to the Alhambra, this 16th century building was commissioned following the Reconquista by Charles V as a royal residence close to the Alhambra palace. The square two-level structure is done in Renaissance style with an impressive circular courtyard ringed by a colonnade within. The building is also home to two museums, the\nMuseo de la Alhambra\non the lower floor with a collection of artifacts and art from the Alhambra, and the\nMuseo de Bellas Artes\n, a small fine art museum on the upper floor, as well as a couple of changing museum exhibits which regularly feature art with some connection to the Alhambra.\nThe ceiling in the Hall of the Two Sisters, Palacios Nazaries\n37.17739\n-3.58999\n12\nPalacios Nazaries\n. The Nasrid royal palace and the primary (and thus most crowded) attraction of the Alhambra complex, the palace is an impressive, at times breathtakingly beautiful work of architecture. Visitors get to see spectacular archways and windows, carved wooden ceilings, intricate molded-plaster work and colourful ceramic tiles at nearly every turn as they meander between lovely rooms and lush courtyards. Everyone starts their tour in the\nMexuar\n, a set of administrative rooms with a beautiful prayer room and a small square courtyard with the golden\nFaçade of Comares\n, before emerging in the\nCourt of the Myrtles\n, a rectangular courtyard with a long pool of water flanked on each side by a myrtle hedge (hence the name). At the end of the courtyard you can enter a room to view the twelve\nLion Statues\nfrom the fountain in the Court of the Lions, which is undergoing renovation. Cross to the other end of the Court of the Myrtles to enter the\nShip Room\n, with its spectacular carved wooden ceiling in the shape of an upside-down hull, and the\nChamber of the Ambassadors\n, the palace's largest and perhaps most spectacular room, which once functioned as the throne room and features a star-studded wooden ceiling, intricately carved stucco walls and beautiful arched windows.  From here you'll pass through a series of small rooms, including the\nWashington Irving Room\n, where Washington Irving wrote\nTales of the Alhambra\n, as well as down an open-air hallway with an excellent view of an adjacent courtyard (the Court of Linda-Raja) and the Albayzín. Passing by the old bath house you'll enter the\nHall of the Two Sisters\n, a spectacular domed room with an intricate stucco ceiling and lovely views of the Court of Linda-Raja. From here you can navigate around the edge of the\nCourt of the Lions\n(under renovation) to the\nHall of the Abencerrages\n, structurally similar to the Hall of the Two Sisters. At this point you can exit the palace, which will place you near the entrance to the Partal Gardens.\nFountain in the Generalife Palace\n37.17706\n-3.58512\n13\nGeneralife\n. The lush and gorgeous gardens of the Nasrid kings, the expansive Generalife is the finest set of Moorish style gardens in Andalusia, positioned on a hill situated at the rear of the complex overlooking the Alhambra palace. Within you'll find beds of colorful flowers, more exquisite architecture, leaping fountains and cool shade. There are two entrances to the Generalife, one at the ticket booth on the east side of the complex and another next to the Palacios Nazaries which will take you through the\n37.1767\n-3.5886\n14\nPartal Gardens\n, a collection of palace gardens with flowing water streams and a large pool of water which reflects a nearby portico. From the Partal you can follow the\nPromenade of The Towers\n, the remains of the main wall and its adjoining towers that separate the Alhambra palace grounds from the Generalife. As you cross a bridge over a small canyon you'll enter the Generalife proper, where you can follow a promenade past the amphitheater to the\nLower Gardens\n, a collection of hedge rows with rectangular ponds at the center and colorful flower beds throughout. Past this is the\n37.178\n-3.5856\n15\nGeneralife Palace\n, the white structure sitting atop the hill and the highlight of a visit to the gardens, for it is within that you will find spectacular views, lovely architecture, and the much-photographed\nCourt of the Main Canal\n, with its crossing jets of water that arc over the rectangular pool. Nearby is the\nSoultana's Court\n, another picturesque courtyard with leaping fountains. Above the palace are the High Gardens, where you can find a gorgeous long pergola and the\nWater Stairway\n, which true to its name is a beautiful stairway with water flowing down its parapets. The gardens are huge, but the layout is simple as everything in the Generalife can be seen along a long, circular path.\nThese are the four primary attractions, but the grounds hold many secondary sights as well, some of them quite splendid in their own right and many off the beaten path. If entering the Alhambra on foot from Plaza Nueva, you'll travel up Cuesta de Gomerez through the\n37.17609\n-3.59305\n16\nGranada Gate\n, an ornamental archway which marks the entrance to the grounds. From here you can continue straight into the\nBosque\n(forest), a delightfully lush and shady wooded area in the canyon beneath the palace complex with streams running along the footpaths, fountains and statues and, in the summertime, fragrant smells from the trees. If you take the rightmost path up the hill and make a right up the next path you find, you'll come across the\n37.17551\n-3.59338\n17\nBermejas Towers\n, an outpost of the Alhambra on the very edge of the complex, with massive square towers perched on a hill over the neighborhood of Realejo. The towers themselves are locked up and mostly in ruins, but the views of Granada and the Alhambra are splendid. If you take the leftmost path from the Granada Gate you'll travel up to the\n37.17615\n-3.5903\n18\nJustice Gate\n(\nPuerta de Justica\n), an imposing Moorish-style archway and entry that served as the primary entrance to the palace complex in days of old.\nWithin the main palace complex, just above the Justice Gate is a lovely courtyard area, the\n37.17674\n-3.5905\n19\nSquare of the Cisterns\n(\nPlaza de los Aljibes\n) between the Alcazaba and the Palace of Charles V next to the\nWine Gate\n(\nPuerta del Vino\n), another picturesque horseshoe-shaped archway which once protected the grounds. Continuing along the small road past the Palace of Charles V to the upper part of the palace complex, you'll come across a row of woodworking and souvenir shops, the prominent\n37.17642\n-3.58917\n20\nSt. Mary Church\n, the ruins of a village and the\n37.17589\n-3.58721\n21\nParador\n. Though most of the Parador is a restaurant and hotel, parts are still open to the public, including the lovely courtyard entryway and the ruins of a Franciscan monastery, which holds the lovely remains of a small chapel with a view into the hotel's lavish patio area.\nAbove the main palace complex, to the east of the Generalife, are a number of visitor facilities, namely a large parking lot. A short hike uphill from the parking lot is the\n37.1784\n-3.5839\n22\nSilla del Moro\n, the ruins of a guard outpost directly above the Generalife Palace. While it requires an uphill hike and is isolated from the rest of the grounds, the Silla offers what may be the most spectacular view in all of Granada, giving you a rare opportunity to look\ndown\nat the Alhambra palace, as well as a sweeping vista of the city, the valley and the surrounding mountains, with the added benefit of not being nearly as crowded as the San Nicolas Viewpoint in the Albayzín or requiring admission like the Alcazaba.\nAlbayzín\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Albayzín: Pleasant plazas, white-washed buildings, Muslim character and marvelous views\nSituated on a hill above the center of town and across from the Alhambra, the\nAlbayzín\n(also spelled Albaicín, Alayzín, and Albaycín) is an ancient Muslim neighborhood popular with visitors - and rightly so. Among its narrow, winding streets one will find beautiful white-washed old buildings, splendid Arabic shops and restaurants, scenic gardens, and marvelous views of Granada and the Alhambra. Today part of a\nUNESCO World Heritage site\n(along with the nearby neighborhood of Sacromonte and the Alhambra, covered below), Albayzín dates back to the fourteenth century and was built as a defensive town and thrived as one of the centers of Granada under Muslim rule.\nEntering the Albayzín is simple enough - from Plaza Nueva it's just a matter of walking north (uphill), or proceeding east along the Rio Darro (to the Paseo de los Tristes, covered below) and turning north on any of the side streets. However, if coming from the cathedral or anywhere else in central Granada, the best entrance is via\n37.17781\n-3.59722\n23\nCalle Calderería Nueva\n(near bus stop Gran Vía 1), a stepped cobblestone street lined with Arabic restaurants, tea shops, bakeries and shops selling imported goods from North Africa. However once inside the Albayzín you'll find the layout of the streets very confusing, with many steep sections and stairways - though this is indeed part of the charm of the neighborhood, always with a new path to explore or a hidden surprise waiting to be discovered. However, if the climb or the confusing layout sound like too much, you can also take the C1 minibus to the top of the hill from Plaza Nueva.\n37.17864\n-3.59616\n24\nSan José Church\n(\nIglesia de San José\n),\nC/. Cementerio de San José, 2\n,\n☏\n+34 958 227 671\n.\nOpen for masses - winter: M-F and eves of festivals 18:30, Su and festivals 11:00; summer: M-F and eves of festivals 19:00, Su and festivals 11:00\n.\nLocated in a spot previously occupied by the Almorabitín, or mosque of morabites, and is one of the oldest churches in Granada, dating back to the sixteenth century. The architecture of the old mosque is still visible in parts, particularly in the minaret-turned-bell tower.\n37.18112\n-3.59266\n25\nSan Nicolas Viewpoint\n(\nMirador de San Nicolas\n),\nPlaza San Nicolas\n(\nfrom the church at the end of Calle Caldereria Nueva, climb the path leading to the left and keep following the stairs uphill - eventually you will reach Camino Nueva de San Nicolas; at this point turn right and follow the cobblestone street uphill (at one point the road will fork - take the left route) until you reach the viewpoint; or take minibus C1 to Plaza S. Nicolas stop\n).\nAlways open\n.\nThe most popular attraction in the Albayzin for tourists, this spot offers a spectacular view of the Alhambra and the mountains behind, as well as excellent vistas of the city and up the Rio Darro canyon.\nFree\n.\n37.18134\n-3.59201\n26\nMosque of Granada\n(\nMezquita Mayor de Granada\n) (\njust off Plaza San Nicolas\n),\n☏\n+34 958 20 25 26\n.\nFollowing the Reconquista, Islam was banished from Spain and its practitioners were persecuted, effectively stomping out any practice of the religion in Spain for centuries thereafter. But Islam has been making a comeback in Spain and this mosque, built in 2003, stands as a link with the Muslim Granada of old. The mosque maintains an open-door policy and while you need to arrange an appointment to see the main prayer spaces, you are free to enter the fragrant garden and take in the architecture of the rather humble yet beautiful building. Even if you have little interest in Islam the place is still worth visiting for the garden's marvelous view of the Alhambra and for the sight of Moorish-style architecture that's newly constructed rather than ancient and crumbling.\nFree\n.\n37.18261\n-3.59342\n27\nPlaza Larga\n,\nCuesta de Alhacaba and Calle del Agua del Albaicin\n.\nA small and shady plaza, this is the center of Albayzín for its residents, removed from the tourist crowds of the San Nicolas Viewpoint, surrounded by local shops and restaurants and home to a local market on Saturday mornings. On the west edge of the plaza, tucked around a corner, is\nPuerta Nueva\n, a passageway to Placeta de las Minas situated at the end of a remaining section of\ndefensive wall\nwhich once protected the Albayzín. The wall itself is mostly inaccessible, but excellent views of the wall, which really speak to how imposing it must have looked from the outside, are available from the\n37.18312\n-3.59625\n28\nMirador de San Cristobal\nuphill from Plaza Larga (alternatively you can just walk along Cuesta de Alhacaba west from Plaza Larga from excellent views from beneath the wall).\nCarrera del Darro\nBelow the Albayzin is\nCarrera del Darro\n, a narrow street winding from Plaza Nueva along the meandering Rio Darro. This is one of the most scenic walks in Granada, packed with pedestrians strolling the cobblestone way, who have to squeeze to the side every few minutes as a taxi or a minibus passes by. Old shops, apartments, and other buildings cluster up the hill in the Albayzin on one side, and across the Rio Darro along the other side is the steep hill upon which is the Alhambra. Along the street are beautifully preserved buildings, remains of Arab houses, stone bridges crossing the Rio Darro, and plenty of nice restaurants.\n37.17832\n-3.59316\n29\nHamman El Bañuelo\n,\nCarrera del Darro 31\n(\nimmediately across the street from the Bañuelo bus stop, routes C1 and C2\n),\n☏\n+34 958 027 800\n.\nTu-Sa 10:00-14:00\n.\nAn unassuming-looking building from the outside, the Bañuelo is the ruins of perhaps the most well-preserved Arabic bath house in Spain. Once a popular socializing spot during Muslim Granada, most of the bath houses in the city were destroyed followed the Reconquista - this one survived due to the construction of a private home above. Inside you can view the beautiful architecture and learn how the bath house functioned, with its hot and cooling rooms and scenic courtyard.\n€5\n.\n37.17891\n-3.58935\n30\nPaseo de los Tristes\n,\nat the end of Carrera del Darro\n(\nbus stop Paseo de los Tristes, routes C1 and C2\n).\nPerched above the Rio Darro at the end of Carrera del Darro, this plaza was once on the busiest gathering spots in Granada, positioned along a curve of the river between the Alhambra and the Albayzin. Today it is a popular place to eat owing to the restaurants lining the north side of the square and the magnificent views of the Alhambra palace it offers.\nSacromonte\n[\nedit\n]\nSacromonte\nLocals often consider the Albayzín a world away from the rest of Granada, but even the Arabic quarter can't hold a candle to the relative isolation and uniqueness of Sacromonte, a gypsy (\nRoma\n) district situated east of the Albazin, demarcated by the road Cuesta Chapiz. The neighborhood is noted for its many cave dwellings built within the sides of the hill poking out here and there between the scrubby bushes and cacti. The district is also famous for its flamenco shows popular with tourists and the amazing views of the Alhambra.\nTo get to the neighborhood, you can walk or take the C2 minibuses up Carrera del Darro to Paseo de los Tristes. From there walk up Cuesta Chapiz until you reach Peso de Harina (where you'll find a small plaza with a statue of a man with a strange hat, Chorrojumo, who was regarded as the king of the gypsies). From there walk along the Camino del Sacromonte.\n37.1828\n-3.5842\n31\nMuseo Cuevas Sacromonte\n,\nBarranco de los Negros\n,\n☏\n+34 958 215 120\n,\ninfo@sacromontegranada.com\n.\nSummer: Daily 10:00-14:00 and 17:00-20:00; Winter: Daily 10:00-14:00 and 16:00-19:00\n.\nThis museum offers the chance to get to know this neighborhood, with geological and historical exhibits on the caves, the biology, the people and the form of living as well as the traditional handicrafts of the locals.\n€5\n.\n37.1832\n-3.5772\n32\nSacromonte Abbey\n.\nFounded in the seventeenth century.

This section of town is defined to a great degree by the presence of the local university (Universidad de Granada), government buildings, and two of the main points of entry into Granada - the train station and the bus depot.\n37.18216\n-3.60018\n33\nElvira's Gate\n(\nPuerta de Elvira\n),\nPlaza del Triunfo\n.\nOnce the principal gate to the old city, Elvira's Gate now stands on the edge of a plaza, a grand Moorish-style archway over a local street.\n37.184722\n-3.601111\n34\nHospital Real\n,\nAv. del Hospicio\n(\nAv. del Hospicio and Calle Ancha de Capuchinos\n),\n☏\n+34 958 243 025\n.\nM-F 9:00-14:00\n.\nCommissioned in 1504 by Isabel and Ferdinand, this massive square red-brick building was originally used as a hospital for the poor and soldiers who had been injured in the Reconquista of Granada.

Upon entering you'll pass through a cloister garden that serves as the building's tranquil courtyard, with small rooms splitting off from here, many with grisly paintings of martyrs meeting their fates. The single-nave church is spectacular and lavishly decorated, with the sanctuary and sacristy containing many beautifully crafted and intricate artworks.\n€3.50\n.\n37.179228\n-3.603901\n37\nSan Jeronimo Monastery\n(\nMonasterio San Jeronimo\n),\nCalle Rector Lopez Argueta 9\n(\nbus C6, Fuentenueva stop\n),\n☏\n+34 958 279 337\n.\nSummer: Daily 10:00-13:30 and 16:00-19:30; Winter: M-Sa 10:00-13:30 and 15:00-18:30\n.\nThe first monastery to be built in the city after the reconquest by the Christians, this monastery is noted for its picturesque courtyards, the Spanish Baroque-style sacristy and the splendid artwork on display.\n€4\n.\n37.18059\n-3.60297\n38\nBasilica San Juan de Dios\n,\nCalle San Juan de Dios 15\n(\nfrom bus stop Avenida Constitucion 1, walk down Calle San Juan de Dios\n),\n☏\n+34 958 275 700\n.\nM–Sa 10–13 and 16–19, Su 16–19\n.\nA gorgeous example of the Baroque granadino style with an over-the-top interior—not an inch isn't lavishly decorated.

To the west, closer to the center of town, lies bustling\n37.17345\n-3.59964\n39\nPuerta Real\n. Surrounding the intersection of Calle Reyes Catolicos, Calle Recogidas and Acera Del Darro, Puerta Real is the center of modern Granada, a district of grand classical and modern buildings and the city's primary shopping destination.

The gardens date to the nineteenth century and have a blend of Moorish-style elements such as amble shade, decorative arches and bubbling fountains with English and French romantic style elements - one garden has an ornamental duck pond complete with statues, grottoes and follies (keep an eye out for the peacocks that wander the gardens).

It is described officially as a festival of Advanced Music and Multimedia Art. Music is by far the main aspect of the festival. The festival runs for three days and nights, usually starting on a Thursday in the third week of June. There is a day location and a night location.\n€52 daypass, €76 night entry, €199 festival pass on internet booking, higher fees for entrance passes\n.\nMonegros Desert Festival\n.\nThe most famous and biggest one day/night electronic music festivals in Spain is in the desert of Fraga, 200 km (120 mi) from Barcelona. More than 40,000 people gather every July to celebrate electronic music with the best DJs representing styles from house, electro, minimal, techno, to drum&bass, dubstep, and hiphop. 20 hours non-stop, it is a unique desert experience.\n41.3825\n2.1769\n1\nFestes de la Mercè\n.\nBarcelona's main annual festival around 24 September, encompassing many events such as human towers (castellers), free live music events on the streets, firework displays, and processions of wooden giants. It is a holiday and the city offers a lot of activities to have fun. Enjoy a fountains and fireworks show at the base of the Montjuïc hill.\n41.400136\n2.157672\n2\nFestes de Gràcia\n.\nThe Festes de Gracia is a Catalonian celebration, held around 15 August each year to commemorate the Assumption. During the week of festivities that mark one of Barcelona's most important fiestas, the city of Gracia explodes with fun, excitement, colour, and fireworks. Many streets are decorated by neighbours, and there is live music, food in the streets, and the parties continue all night.\n41.375278\n2.136111\n3\nFestes de Sants\n.\nSimilar to Gracia's event, but smaller and later on in August. If you can't go to Gracia's event, try to go to this festival.\nSant Jordi\n.\n23 April. Considered to be like Valentine's Day. People give roses and books around the streets. Traditionally, men give women roses and women give men books. It is one of the most popular and interesting celebrations in Catalonia.\nCasa de l'Ardiaca during Corpus\nCorpus\n.\nLate in May (Corpus Christi day). An egg shell is placed over the jet of water coming out of various fountains such that the egg \"magically dances\" over the water. These fountains typically are beautifully decorated with flowers and are mostly at churches, most of which are located in the city centre: Cathedral's cloister, Santa Anna, Casa de l'Ardiaca, Museu Frederic Marés, and a dozen other fountains.\nFira de Santa Llúcia\n.\nFrom 2/3 December to 23 December, to commemorate St. Llúcia (13 December). During this time, in front of the Cathedral, Christmas objects are sold. Some places sell Christmas trees, but most of them sell elements for making the\npessebres\n(Nativity scenes). These include small sculptures, wooden pieces, and moss used to simulate grass. 13 December is the feast day of Santa Llucia, patron saint of fashion designers and blind people, who gather at the Santa Llucia chapel in the cathedral to pay their respects.\nBarcelona Jazz Festival\n.\nA brighter way to celebrate the colder Autumn days, the annual Jazz festival has been running for nearly 50 years now and runs roughly from the last week in October and all the way through November\nTickets prices differ for each event\n.\nRevetlla de Sant Joan\n.\nThis is the midsummer solstice celebration. It is celebrated on 23 June every year and is signified by the fireworks (there are frequent and loud amateur fireworks all night long, which may make it hard to sleep) that are permanently on display during this time.\nFira de Barcelona\n.\nThere are trade events all year round in Barcelona."

Several streets in the city centre have been transformed into mixed-traffic spaces where pedestrians and bikes have priority over cars. There are new easy-bike paths all along the river and connecting important parks.\nIt is also possible to use a lot of narrow easy streets where traffic is slow and calm to travel along the city without depending on exclusive bike paths. There are some official and unofficial publications with these streets along the web.\nTo avoid some of Madrid inconveniencies, such as hot weather or slopy streets it is also possible to get bikes on Metro and Railways trains with some schedule restrictions, and on every public transport without restrictions when using folding-bikes.\nMadrid's public bike rental service, called\nBiciMAD\n. It boasts 1560 electric bikes spread over 123 stations. Unfortunately, the site is not yet available in English. However, the information at the bike stations is available in multiple languages. A casual user pays no initial fee, but €2 for every first hour or fraction, and €4 for the second (Oct 2019). A contactless card is issued instantaneously upon signing up at any bike station. The process is relatively quick and requires some basic information such as name, ID, email and credit card number. Swipe the card through the somewhat larger opening on the left of any bike to retrieve it. Use the buttons to the left of the handlebar to toggle electric assistance. Here you'll also find a button to switch on the lights. So watch out, you'll need to do this yourself when it gets dark! Be equally careful when using electric assistance for the first time, as it might require some getting used to.\nThere are also some rent shops in the historical centre area such as the company\nBaja Bikes Madrid\n. This company offers several rental points in Madrid at Retiro, Atocha, Madrid-Río, etc. They offer guided and self-guided bicycle tours, using electric or conventional bicycles.\n40.41887\n-3.70076\n1\nTrixi bike tours\n,\nc/Jardines 12\n,\n☏\n+34 915 231 547\n.\nBicycle tours and rental from €4/hr.

It protects the largest laurel rainforest remaining on Earth, \"almost as old as the island itself\" — the vegetation type has stayed the same for millions of years. The forest is made up of different evergreens flourishing under the mild temperatures. Trees are irrigated by the mist which sometimes covers the top of the island, especially in winter. The trees are covered in mosses and lichens. This environment extended all around the Mediterranean Sea in the Tertiary Era, so the National Park is considered a living relic. Several species endemic to the Canary Islands live here, including the Gomeran lizard, Gomeran skink, stripeless tree frog, laurel pigeon and Bolle's pigeon.

Always make sure that somebody knows where you are heading and when you can be expected to return. Pack rain and windproof and warm clothing in your day-pack, even it is nice and sunny when you leave. Also, don't forget to take a phone and a flashlight with you, drinking water and something to eat. However, there are also many shorter walks (such as up one side of Valle Gran Rey and down the other) that need no more than sandals.\nHiking in heavy rain can be dangerous (as well as unpleasant) due to rock falls and landslides.\nOrganized\n[\nedit\n]\nSeveral companies offer guided walks, which can be useful if you don't have transport or want to do a point to point walk. One of these companies is\nTimah\n[dead link]\n. They offer guided walks at around €30 each (including the transportation to the starting point of the walk as well as the trip back) with English and German speaking guides.\nAnother company offering walks is\nViajes Temocoda\n[dead link]\n. Temocoda's walks are a little bit more expensive but lunch is included in the price.\nVisit the tourist office in Valle Gran Rey (Calle Lepanto, s/n. La Playa) or the various travel agencies in Valle Gran Rey for information about other providers of walks. Agencies can usually make the booking for you, but at least Timah has an office in Valle Gran Rey (La Puntilla) and you can book your walk there as well.\nGuided walks can be recommended not only because they include transportation and free you from the infrequent bus service, but the guides will tell you all sorts of interesting tidbits about the island.\nSelf-guided\n[\nedit\n]\nA good map for trails (and even\nGPS navigation\n) is central:\nDigital:\nOpenStreetMap\n, which many mobile apps like\nOsmAnd\nor\nMapy.cz\nuse, provides highly detailed and complete maps of the island, including hiking trails.\nWikiloc\n, in addition, provides hundreds of possible downloadable trails by other hikers\nAnalog:\nDWG\n[dead link]\nKompass\nFreydag & Berndt\nBooks:\nThe Landscapes of Southern Tenerife and La Gomera\nby\nSunflower Books\nWalk! La Gomera\n[dead link]\nby DWG\nMaps and guidebooks are readily available in San Sebastian and Valle Gran Rey.\nMountain biking\n[\nedit\n]\nLa Gomera is a good biking destination as it offers mountainous paved roads as well as single trails and dirt roads for the mountain bikers. In Valle Gran Rey there are three mountain bike tour operators and bike rentals available in the villages of La Playa, La Puntilla and Vueltas.\nBe careful when riding down as the roads are steep and have tight bends. There are also two tunnels when coming down to Valle Gran Rey. The second and longer one can be circumvented by using the old road instead which goes by the mountainside. It starts on the right hand side of the tunnel entrance. However,\nextreme care is required\nas the railings on the old road are not in good condition (or missing altogether in places) and there are also big rocks and other debris on the road. When you drive in the tunnels make sure you have a headlight and a backlight (or at least a red reflector) so that cars can see you well ahead. Never ride without a well-fitting helmet.\nRelaxing\n[\nedit\n]\nThe slow pace of life is contagious, the perfect antidote to stress. If you lack transport to Garojonay, walking in Valle Gran Rey (playa Del Ingles to beyond Vueltas) is easy and relaxing.\nBeaches\n[\nedit\n]\nPlaya de Alojera\nThere are beaches at the end of most valleys, of varying quality.\nValle Gran Rey has safe sandy beaches at Vueltas and El Charco (literally 'The Puddle'). There is a semi-nude beach (clothing is optional) called Playa del Ingles further down the road that goes along La Playa in Valle Gran Rey. However, it's rocky and very dangerous for swimming especially when the sea is rough.\nSan Sebastian has two good beaches.\nPlaya Santiago (as the name suggests) also has a beach.\nThere is a public pool at Playa de Vallehermoso (under renovation as of July 2021),\nThere is a sea swimming pool by the remains of the Embarcadero in Hermigua, and Playa la Caleta, near Hermigua, has a bar/restaurant on the beach (not operating as of July 2021).\nIf you don't mind the long, steep, winding drive, there is a lovely little beach at Alojera.\nNote:\nSwimming can be challenging and even dangerous on the open beaches around the island. There are warning signs on the beaches, for instance at Playa del Ingles, the latest fatal accident happened in the end of 2005. The latest fatal accidents in Playa del Ingles and in La Playa were in 2019.\nFlora\n[\nedit\n]\nFascinating sub-tropical vegetation abounds with the unique Laurisilva rainforest in the national park, Garajonay, which is situated on the highest part of La Gomera. Laurisilva has a very special property in that it makes clouds into rain: Due to the pressing upwards of the trade winds, there are often clouds on the top of La Gomera; but the leaves of the trees of Laurisilva have pores that catch the small drops from the clouds. The surplus water absorbed is secreted so that the trees are raining, which increases precipitation from 50-100%. Of the remaining Laurisilva is 50% growing on La Gomera, which makes Garajonay unique from a nature conservation point of view. Laurisilva has in earlier periods covered large areas surrounding the Middle Sea, but disappeared due to climate changes. The National Visitor Centre at Juego de Bolas, above Las Rosas, has a selection of native and endemic plants, as well as various artesanal artifacts. There are plenty fine walking paths in Garajonay and the surrounding landscape.\nThere is also a botanic garden of sorts near Vallehermoso. This could be excellent if better maintained, but has the air of somewhere abandoned.\nPhotography\n[\nedit\n]\nLa Gomera is so beautiful that photo opportunities are everywhere. Most main roads have clearly signed viewpoints, including parking for a short stop.\nDiving\n[\nedit\n]\nLa Gomera is perfect for diving, and there are many people pursuing this passion. But there are no commercial diving schools. There is a dive club in San Sebastian (\nEl Sebadal\n), and there is privately led dive base in the harbour of Valle Gran Rey.\nWhale watching\n[\nedit\n]\nWhale watching\nboat trips run from Valle Gran Rey with\nExcursiones Tina\n,\nExcursiones Yani\nor\nOceano Gomera\n."

Walking through you're sure to take in the sights, smells and sounds of superb architecture, good food, and pleasant conversations among residents.\n37.175644\n-3.597506\n1\nPlaza Isabel la Catolica\n,\nat the intersection of Gran Via de Colon and Calle Reyes Catolicos\n.\nAt the junction of Granada's two grand boulevards is this small square with a prominent statue of Columbus unfurling a contract with Queen Isabel, outlining the terms of their agreement in preparation for his first voyage to the Americas, an event which likely occurred in Granada. A pleasant fountain surrounds the statue and there are benches nearby, allowing you to relax and take in the passing crowds of vehicles and people.\nGazing up into the\nCapilla Mayor\n, Cathedral of Granada\n37.17599\n-3.59904\n2\nCathedral of Granada\n(\nLa Catedral de Granada\n),\nGran Via de Colon 5\n(\nenter from Gran Via just north of Plaza Isabel la Catolica; bus stop Gran Via 1\n),\n☏\n+34 958 225 488\n.\nMarch–August: M-Sa 10:45-13:30 and 16:00-20:00, Su and holidays 16:00-20:00; September–February: M-Sa 10:45-13:30 and 16:00-19:00, Su 16:00-19:00\n.\nTowering over the surrounding blocks is this spectacular 16th century structure, the second-largest cathedral in Spain and noted for its bright Renaissance interior. Constructed after the Reconquista of Granada to replace the mosque on the site, the cathedral was laid out with Gothic foundations but built in the Renaissance style and decorated with Baroque elements. Upon entering you'll be behind the main altar, located beneath the towering circular\nCapilla Mayor\n(sanctuary) with its magnificent domed ceiling. Surrounding the sanctuary and the pews are a series of chapels with magnificent artwork, and the sacristy (tucked away on your right immediately after entering) holds a collection of fine paintings, mirrors, and furnishings. Additionally, the spectacular\nfaçade\nof the cathedral (on the west side of the structure, opposite the Gran Via) is worth walking around outside to view - based on the design of a triumphal arch, it overshadows the small square below.\n€5\n.\n37.175986\n-3.599036\n3\nRoyal Chapel\n(\nCapilla Real\n),\nc/ Oficios\n(\nenter from Calle Oficios, the small alley on the south side of the cathedral; bus stop Gran Via 1\n),\n☏\n+34 958 227 848\n.\nAutumn-Winter: M-Sa 10:15-13.30 and 15:30-18:30, Su and holidays 11:00-13:30 and 15:30-18:30h; Spring-Summer: M-Sa 10:15-13:30 and 16:00-19:30, Su and holidays 11:00-13:30 and 16:00-19:30\n.\nCommissioned after the Reconquista of the city, the Royal Chapel holds the tombs of King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I, the famed Catholic Monarchs who conquered the city and decided to be buried at the site of their victory. The chapel was constructed in Gothic style but the intricate marble tombs are done in Renaissance style. Additionally, Ferdinand and Isabella's heirs Juana I (\nJuana la Loca\n) and Philip I (\nFelipe el Hermoso\n) are buried here. Aside from the beautiful and intricate artwork in the chapel and high altar there is also a museum on-site with a number of objects symbolizing Ferdinand and Isabel's rule, including Isabella's art collection, crown and sceptre and Ferdinand's sword.\nAdults €5, under 12 free, students €3.50\n.\n(\nupdated May 2023\n)\n37.175278\n-3.6\n4\nPlaza de Bib-Rambla\n,\na block west of the Cathedral\n.\nA pleasant square with a view of the cathedral's tower, this plaza was originally the center of Moorish Granada, a bustling focus point of markets and festivals. Under Christian rule the square was expanded and used as a focal point of Catholic processions. Today the square is a quiet place to relax, enjoy a coffee or a meal, or take in the colorful flowers and bubbling fountain.\nShops in the Alcaiceria\n37.17563\n-3.59887\n5\nAlcaiceria\n.\nSouth of the Cathedral is this set of winding alleyways which were originally home to a Moorish silk market under Granada's Muslim rule. Although the market initially survived the Reconquista, Philip II had it shut down and a fire destroyed what was left in 1850. Today's market was rebuilt in the late 19th century for tourists and holds mostly souvenir stores underneath the Moorish-style archways decorating the walls. While the wares are mostly tacky novelties, the architecture is worth a look.\n37.17492\n-3.59795\n6\nCorral del Carbón\n(\nfrom Calle Reyes Catolicos, head down the alley Puente del Carbon to the building with the pointed Moorish style arch at the end of the alley\n),\n☏\n+34 958 225 990\n.\nEntrance viewable anytime, courtyard open M-F 9:00-19:00, Sa-Su 10:00-14:00\n.\nOne of the rare bits of Moorish architecture left in the central district, this courtyard building is perhaps the oldest monument in Granada. Originally the building was used as a caravanserai - a place for merchants to rest and store goods - and was one of many surrounding the Alcaiceria. Later it was adapted for theater plays and today you can buy tickets for musical events here.

Surrounding the square is a multitude of bars and tapas restaurants (making the square the city's center for nightlife) as well as several important buildings such as the Royal Chancellery (\nReal Chancilleria\n), the House of Pisa (\nCasa de Los Pisa\n), and the\nChurch of Santa Ana\non the east side of the square, a 16th century church constructed in Mudejar style with a lovely tower.\n37.17767\n-3.59533\n8\nMuseo San Juan de Dios\n,\nC/ Convalecencia 1\n(\njust off Plaza Nueva\n),\n☏\n+34 958 222 144\n.\n10:00-13:30\n.\nA very rich religious art collection.\n€3\n.\n37.175806\n-3.598833\n9\nCentro José Guerrero\n(\nMuseo José Guerrero\n),\nCalle Oficios 8\n,\n☏\n+34 958 220 109\n,\ncentro.guerrero@dipgra.es\n.\nTu-Sa 10:00-14:00 16:30-21:00, Su 10:30-14:00\n.\nA small museum dedicated to the Granada-born painter José Guerrero.

    "text": "The Alhambra\n[\nedit\n]\nCourt of the Myrtles, Palacios Nazaries\nPalace of Charles V\nThe\nAlhambra\n: Part fortress (the\nAlcazaba\n), part palace (\nPalacios Nazaries\n), part garden (the\nGeneralife\n) and part government city (the\nMedina\n), this medieval complex overlooking Granada is one of the top attractions in Spain, with many visitors coming to Granada expressly to see the Alhambra.  The last Moorish stronghold in Europe, the Alhambra reflects the splendor of Moorish civilization in Andalusia and offers the visitor splendid ornamental architecture, spectacular and lush gardens, cascading and dripping water features, and breathtaking views of the city. This impressive fortress complex is deservedly listed as a\nUNESCO World Heritage site\n.\nThe Alhambra was a palace, citadel, fortress and the home of the Nasrid sultans, high government officials, servants of the court and elite soldiers from the 13th to the 14th century. Other notable buildings belonging to a different time period are also located within the Alhambra complex, most notably the Renaissance style Palace of Charles V, which houses the Alhambra Museum (with historical artifacts from the site) and the Fine Art Museum.\nBut in order to fully appreciate the unique architecture of the Alhambra set within the surrounding landscape, it is advisable to see the Alhambra for afar as well as up close: several locations in the Albaizín (most notably the San Nicolás Viewpoint) or Sacromonte, both covered below, allow you the opportunity to truly admire the Alhambra's spectacular location, lying just above the city of Granada.\nThe Alhambra is a vast complex, composed of many structures and gardens on its lush grounds, which alone are worth exploring; it is free to do so and they are open nearly all hours of the day. There are four primary attractions: the Alcazaba, the Palace of Charles V, the Palacios Nazaries and the Generalife.\nOfficial web site at\nwww.alhambra-patronato.es\n[dead link]\n, where you can buy tickets online. Mar-Oct every day 8:30-22:00 plus F/Sa 22:00-23:30; Oct-Mar every day 8:30-18:00 plus F/Sa 20:00-21:30 (\nticket office closes one hour before attraction, evening visits to Palacios Nazaries only\n). €14 combo ticket for Palacios Nazaries, Alcazaba and Generalife, €7 for just the Alcazaba and Generalife, €8 for an evening visit to the Palacios Nazaries, and €5 for an evening visit to the Generalife. Palace of Charles V free.\nReservations:\nIt is strongly recommended that you book tickets to the Alhambra in advance, as the number of visitors allowed inside the Palacios Nazaries is limited and tickets tend to sell out. These can be booked\nonline via the official website\n, by phone (\n+34\n902 888 001), or in person at the main entrance to the Alhambra or at the Tienda de la Alhambra shop on Calle Reyes Católicos in the city centre. Note that the online and phone reservation services require a credit card (which you must bring with you to the Alhambra ticket office to pick up your tickets) and charge an extra 10% fee on top of the cost of admission. Online tickets are usually sold out many days or even months in advance, but every day more tickets are put on sale: that means you can get an online ticket by checking the website daily, the refresh happens at midnight. Several hundred tickets are reserved for sale on the day but these usually require arriving early and queuing for an hour or two. As of September 2023, it's been reported that no tickets are available to purchase on site when they are sold out on the official website. The \"Granada Card\" or \"Doble de Oro General\" can still be available after the regular tickets have sold out. Failing that, quite a lot of the grounds are accessible without a ticket. This general caution applies to cruise ship land tours (e.g., from Malaga); failure to book Alhambra tours early (before or during cruise) may mean no tours or buses are available.\nNote that the Palacios Nazaries can only be accessed for a half-hour time window (shown on the ticket) within your visiting period. The rest of the Alhambra can be visited the full day without any time restrictions.\nGetting there:\nFrom central Granada, the C3 bus offers a direct connection to the Alhambra from Plaza Isabel La Catolica. There are three stops for the Alhambra:\nGeneralife\n(closest to the ticket office),\nCarlos V\n(closest to the Palace of Charles V) and\nPuerta de la Justica\n, the fare is €1.40. A taxi from the central district (head to the stand on Plaza Nueva) costs around €6. On foot, you can walk up to the Alhambra from Plaza Nueva (about a 30-minute hike) by taking Cuesta de Gomerez and heading straight; the ticket office is on the far side of the grounds, near the Generalife. If coming by car from outside the city, you can bypass the historic district by taking the Ronda Sur-Alhambra exit (A-395) from the highway and following the signs to the parking lot (€1.75/hour).\n37.17708\n-3.59176\n1\nAlcazaba\n. The ruins of a massive fortress perched atop the crest of the hill overlooking the city, this is the oldest part of the Alhambra and offers some of the finest views of anywhere in the complex, with an expansive panorama from the top of the prominent tower that gives you a spectacular view of nearly the entire city and the Sierra Nevada mountains. Within the fort's walls are the ruins of a town which once held soldier's homes and baths, though today only the outline of these rooms remain.\n37.17678\n-3.5899\n2\nPalace of Charles V\n(\nPalacio de Carlos V\n). A more recent addition to the Alhambra, this 16th century building was commissioned following the Reconquista by Charles V as a royal residence close to the Alhambra palace. The square two-level structure is done in Renaissance style with an impressive circular courtyard ringed by a colonnade within. The building is also home to two museums, the\nMuseo de la Alhambra\non the lower floor with a collection of artifacts and art from the Alhambra, and the\nMuseo de Bellas Artes\n, a small fine art museum on the upper floor, as well as a couple of changing museum exhibits which regularly feature art with some connection to the Alhambra.\nThe ceiling in the Hall of the Two Sisters, Palacios Nazaries\n37.17739\n-3.58999\n3\nPalacios Nazaries\n. The Nasrid royal palace and the primary (and thus most crowded) attraction of the Alhambra complex, the palace is an impressive, at times breathtakingly beautiful work of architecture. Visitors get to see spectacular archways and windows, carved wooden ceilings, intricate molded-plaster work and colourful ceramic tiles at nearly every turn as they meander between lovely rooms and lush courtyards. Everyone starts their tour in the\nMexuar\n, a set of administrative rooms with a beautiful prayer room and a small square courtyard with the golden\nFaçade of Comares\n, before emerging in the\nCourt of the Myrtles\n, a rectangular courtyard with a long pool of water flanked on each side by a myrtle hedge (hence the name). At the end of the courtyard you can enter a room to view the twelve\nLion Statues\nfrom the fountain in the Court of the Lions, which is undergoing renovation. Cross to the other end of the Court of the Myrtles to enter the\nShip Room\n, with its spectacular carved wooden ceiling in the shape of an upside-down hull, and the\nChamber of the Ambassadors\n, the palace's largest and perhaps most spectacular room, which once functioned as the throne room and features a star-studded wooden ceiling, intricately carved stucco walls and beautiful arched windows.  From here you'll pass through a series of small rooms, including the\nWashington Irving Room\n, where Washington Irving wrote\nTales of the Alhambra\n, as well as down an open-air hallway with an excellent view of an adjacent courtyard (the Court of Linda-Raja) and the Albayzín. Passing by the old bath house you'll enter the\nHall of the Two Sisters\n, a spectacular domed room with an intricate stucco ceiling and lovely views of the Court of Linda-Raja. From here you can navigate around the edge of the\nCourt of the Lions\n(under renovation) to the\nHall of the Abencerrages\n, structurally similar to the Hall of the Two Sisters. At this point you can exit the palace, which will place you near the entrance to the Partal Gardens.\nFountain in the Generalife Palace\n37.17706\n-3.58512\n4\nGeneralife\n. The lush and gorgeous gardens of the Nasrid kings, the expansive Generalife is the finest set of Moorish style gardens in Andalusia, positioned on a hill situated at the rear of the complex overlooking the Alhambra palace. Within you'll find beds of colorful flowers, more exquisite architecture, leaping fountains and cool shade. There are two entrances to the Generalife, one at the ticket booth on the east side of the complex and another next to the Palacios Nazaries which will take you through the\n37.1767\n-3.5886\n5\nPartal Gardens\n, a collection of palace gardens with flowing water streams and a large pool of water which reflects a nearby portico. From the Partal you can follow the\nPromenade of The Towers\n, the remains of the main wall and its adjoining towers that separate the Alhambra palace grounds from the Generalife. As you cross a bridge over a small canyon you'll enter the Generalife proper, where you can follow a promenade past the amphitheater to the\nLower Gardens\n, a collection of hedge rows with rectangular ponds at the center and colorful flower beds throughout. Past this is the\n37.178\n-3.5856\n6\nGeneralife Palace\n, the white structure sitting atop the hill and the highlight of a visit to the gardens, for it is within that you will find spectacular views, lovely architecture, and the much-photographed\nCourt of the Main Canal\n, with its crossing jets of water that arc over the rectangular pool. Nearby is the\nSoultana's Court\n, another picturesque courtyard with leaping fountains. Above the palace are the High Gardens, where you can find a gorgeous long pergola and the\nWater Stairway\n, which true to its name is a beautiful stairway with water flowing down its parapets. The gardens are huge, but the layout is simple as everything in the Generalife can be seen along a long, circular path.\nThese are the four primary attractions, but the grounds hold many secondary sights as well, some of them quite splendid in their own right and many off the beaten path. If entering the Alhambra on foot from Plaza Nueva, you'll travel up Cuesta de Gomerez through the\n37.17609\n-3.59305\n7\nGranada Gate\n, an ornamental archway which marks the entrance to the grounds. From here you can continue straight into the\nBosque\n(forest), a delightfully lush and shady wooded area in the canyon beneath the palace complex with streams running along the footpaths, fountains and statues and, in the summertime, fragrant smells from the trees. If you take the rightmost path up the hill and make a right up the next path you find, you'll come across the\n37.17551\n-3.59338\n8\nBermejas Towers\n, an outpost of the Alhambra on the very edge of the complex, with massive square towers perched on a hill over the neighborhood of Realejo. The towers themselves are locked up and mostly in ruins, but the views of Granada and the Alhambra are splendid. If you take the leftmost path from the Granada Gate you'll travel up to the\n37.17615\n-3.5903\n9\nJustice Gate\n(\nPuerta de Justica\n), an imposing Moorish-style archway and entry that served as the primary entrance to the palace complex in days of old.\nWithin the main palace complex, just above the Justice Gate is a lovely courtyard area, the\n37.17674\n-3.5905\n10\nSquare of the Cisterns\n(\nPlaza de los Aljibes\n) between the Alcazaba and the Palace of Charles V next to the\nWine Gate\n(\nPuerta del Vino\n), another picturesque horseshoe-shaped archway which once protected the grounds. Continuing along the small road past the Palace of Charles V to the upper part of the palace complex, you'll come across a row of woodworking and souvenir shops, the prominent\n37.17642\n-3.58917\n11\nSt. Mary Church\n, the ruins of a village and the\n37.17589\n-3.58721\n12\nParador\n. Though most of the Parador is a restaurant and hotel, parts are still open to the public, including the lovely courtyard entryway and the ruins of a Franciscan monastery, which holds the lovely remains of a small chapel with a view into the hotel's lavish patio area.\nAbove the main palace complex, to the east of the Generalife, are a number of visitor facilities, namely a large parking lot. A short hike uphill from the parking lot is the\n37.1784\n-3.5839\n13\nSilla del Moro\n, the ruins of a guard outpost directly above the Generalife Palace. While it requires an uphill hike and is isolated from the rest of the grounds, the Silla offers what may be the most spectacular view in all of Granada, giving you a rare opportunity to look\ndown\nat the Alhambra palace, as well as a sweeping vista of the city, the valley and the surrounding mountains, with the added benefit of not being nearly as crowded as the San Nicolas Viewpoint in the Albayzín or requiring admission like the Alcazaba."

The Prado goes back to the royal art collection which - for a nation that was the world's leading superpower for two centuries - is of course quite impressive. The Reina Sofía was opened to house what the Prado \"had no room for\" with a dividing line based on era ultimately being drawn.

Among its narrow, winding streets one will find beautiful white-washed old buildings, splendid Arabic shops and restaurants, scenic gardens, and marvelous views of Granada and the Alhambra. Today part of a\nUNESCO World Heritage site\n(along with the nearby neighborhood of Sacromonte and the Alhambra, covered below), Albayzín dates back to the fourteenth century and was built as a defensive town and thrived as one of the centers of Granada under Muslim rule.\nEntering the Albayzín is simple enough - from Plaza Nueva it's just a matter of walking north (uphill), or proceeding east along the Rio Darro (to the Paseo de los Tristes, covered below) and turning north on any of the side streets. However, if coming from the cathedral or anywhere else in central Granada, the best entrance is via\n37.17781\n-3.59722\n1\nCalle Calderería Nueva\n(near bus stop Gran Vía 1), a stepped cobblestone street lined with Arabic restaurants, tea shops, bakeries and shops selling imported goods from North Africa. However once inside the Albayzín you'll find the layout of the streets very confusing, with many steep sections and stairways - though this is indeed part of the charm of the neighborhood, always with a new path to explore or a hidden surprise waiting to be discovered. However, if the climb or the confusing layout sound like too much, you can also take the C1 minibus to the top of the hill from Plaza Nueva.\n37.17864\n-3.59616\n2\nSan José Church\n(\nIglesia de San José\n),\nC/.

But Islam has been making a comeback in Spain and this mosque, built in 2003, stands as a link with the Muslim Granada of old. The mosque maintains an open-door policy and while you need to arrange an appointment to see the main prayer spaces, you are free to enter the fragrant garden and take in the architecture of the rather humble yet beautiful building. Even if you have little interest in Islam the place is still worth visiting for the garden's marvelous view of the Alhambra and for the sight of Moorish-style architecture that's newly constructed rather than ancient and crumbling.\nFree\n.\n37.18261\n-3.59342\n5\nPlaza Larga\n,\nCuesta de Alhacaba and Calle del Agua del Albaicin\n.\nA small and shady plaza, this is the center of Albayzín for its residents, removed from the tourist crowds of the San Nicolas Viewpoint, surrounded by local shops and restaurants and home to a local market on Saturday mornings. On the west edge of the plaza, tucked around a corner, is\nPuerta Nueva\n, a passageway to Placeta de las Minas situated at the end of a remaining section of\ndefensive wall\nwhich once protected the Albayzín. The wall itself is mostly inaccessible, but excellent views of the wall, which really speak to how imposing it must have looked from the outside, are available from the\n37.18312\n-3.59625\n6\nMirador de San Cristobal\nuphill from Plaza Larga (alternatively you can just walk along Cuesta de Alhacaba west from Plaza Larga from excellent views from beneath the wall).\nCarrera del Darro\nBelow the Albayzin is\nCarrera del Darro\n, a narrow street winding from Plaza Nueva along the meandering Rio Darro. This is one of the most scenic walks in Granada, packed with pedestrians strolling the cobblestone way, who have to squeeze to the side every few minutes as a taxi or a minibus passes by. Old shops, apartments, and other buildings cluster up the hill in the Albayzin on one side, and across the Rio Darro along the other side is the steep hill upon which is the Alhambra. Along the street are beautifully preserved buildings, remains of Arab houses, stone bridges crossing the Rio Darro, and plenty of nice restaurants.\n37.17832\n-3.59316\n7\nHamman El Bañuelo\n,\nCarrera del Darro 31\n(\nimmediately across the street from the Bañuelo bus stop, routes C1 and C2\n),\n☏\n+34 958 027 800\n.\nTu-Sa 10:00-14:00\n.\nAn unassuming-looking building from the outside, the Bañuelo is the ruins of perhaps the most well-preserved Arabic bath house in Spain. Once a popular socializing spot during Muslim Granada, most of the bath houses in the city were destroyed followed the Reconquista - this one survived due to the construction of a private home above. Inside you can view the beautiful architecture and learn how the bath house functioned, with its hot and cooling rooms and scenic courtyard.\n€5\n.\n37.17891\n-3.58935\n8\nPaseo de los Tristes\n,\nat the end of Carrera del Darro\n(\nbus stop Paseo de los Tristes, routes C1 and C2\n).\nPerched above the Rio Darro at the end of Carrera del Darro, this plaza was once on the busiest gathering spots in Granada, positioned along a curve of the river between the Alhambra and the Albayzin.

    "wiki_url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/San_Sebasti%C3%A1n#Eat",
    "text": "Eat\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Basque cuisine is famous within Spain and many believe it is the Basque Country where you can find the best food. Much of this fame comes from San Sebastian and its bars and restaurants.\nAlthough tapas were invented in Andalucia they became perfected in San Sebastian and a walk through the old town before lunch time with its many bars shows why. Each bar is bursting with tapas and they look very delicate. Tapas are generally enjoyed together with a glass of wine or a small beer, and the Spanish tradition suggests to have one tapa and a wine in one bar and move on to the next bar. Tapas can be used as a good substitute for a meal - you pay for each one you eat (about €2-4 each) so you can have as many as you want.\nIf you want 'real' food then that is where San Sebastian can be very good. You can find several different cuisines such Chinese, German, Galician, Italian and of course the obvious Basque cuisine. In and around the harbor you can have the freshest seafood and if you don’t enjoy the simple harbour taverns go and enjoy San Sebastian restaurants with Michelin stars if you have some money to spare.\nSan Sebastian is not a place for vegetarians or vegans, unless you are able to catch the fresh produce markets in the morning and cook for yourself. Pescetarians can get along fine with the abundance of seafood offered on menus.\nLo Mejor de la Gastronomia\nholds annual conference and competition in November, including nominations for pintxos bars and for restaurants.\nHealthy breakfast (even omelet) is hard to find in cafes: typically sandwiches or breakfast variety of pintxos are offered.\nPintxos\n[\nedit\n]\nSan Sebastian old town Pinchos\nThe way to eat\npintxos\n, (tapas in the Basque Country whether speaking Spanish or Basque) in San Sebastian is quite different from other cities in Spain. There are two kinds of tapas: cold and hot ones.\nDon't attempt to eat pintxos if you're starving, you'll treat it like a buffet and prices will easily rack up as everything seems more appealing. Only get a couple of pintxos at a time as sometimes what looks really appealing, has been sitting on the bar the whole day and is past its use by date. Test the waters. Cold ones are displayed on the bar. Just ask the barman for your drink and pick the pintxos yourself. If you need a plate, just ask.\nHot ones must be ordered from the barman and they take a short time to be cooked. There is always a hot tapas menu hanging from the wall.\nWhen you are done eating your tapas and have finished your drink you ask the barman for the bill, and you have to tell him what you have eaten. It is very important to be honest, as it is a long tradition. Locals will be upset if they find people eating and not paying. Normally you don't eat many pintxos at one bar but move from bar to bar, drinking a beer (caña) or wine and eating one or two tapas. Then you move to another bar. Traditionally residents would have one or two pintxos in the early evening to stave off any hunger before a later sit-down meal, rather than making a meal out of a large number of pintxos.\nGenerally, if the barman asks you to show your plate to them before you start eating, you know the bar markets towards tourists and is sub par and more expensive that it should be. A good bar will ask you what you've eaten as you pay and you should see a chef working out the back.\nMost pintxo bars are to be found in the old town, particularly on the streets running parallel to Boulevard. Generally a pintxo will cost €2-3. At some bars the pintxos are all priced the same, at others the price depends on the pintxo. Pintxos (tapas) bars are thick in the\nParte Vieja\n(Old Town), but there are masses of other places nearby in the\nGros\nand\nCentro\nareas. Most bars charge by the toothpick or plate from €1-5.\nThe Jamon Iberico (usually seen hanging from the ceiling in whole leg portions) is ubiquitous, and equally good virtually everywhere. The calamari seems to be the same at every bar, don't order it again at a different pintxo bar if you didn't like it the first time.\nCook-by-order pintxos\n[\nedit\n]\nSome slightly pricier pintxo bars that don't have pre-cooked pintxos and only cook them on order (correspondingly, their pintxo are of higher quality).\nBudget\n[\nedit\n]\n43.32051\n-1.983354\n1\nBideluze\n,\nGaribai Kalea, 24\n.\n(\nupdated Feb 2023\n)\n43.322464\n-1.985081\n2\nPollitena\n,\nC. de San Jerónimo, 3\n.\nBasque restaurant\n(\nupdated Feb 2023\n)\n43.323405\n-1.983813\n3\nQuébec Krep'Herria\n,\nFermin Calbeton Kalea, 11\n.\nCrêpes\n(\nupdated Feb 2023\n)\n43.323479\n-1.983348\n4\nJosé Mari\n,\nFermin Calbeton Kalea, 5\n.\nBasque restaurant\n(\nupdated Feb 2023\n)\n43.322648\n-1.972077\n5\nKixkurra Taberna 1987\n,\nGloria Kalea, 2A\n.\n(\nupdated Feb 2023\n)\n43.325877\n-1.97261\n6\nPincel\n,\nSegundo Izpizua Kalea, 2\n.\n(\nupdated Feb 2023\n)\nPintxos\n[\nedit\n]\n43.323581\n-1.984339\n7\nTamboril\n,\nArrandegi Kalea, 2\n(\nOld Town (Parte Vieja) in the corner of the main square\n).\n(\nupdated Feb 2023\n)\n43.323591\n-1.983327\n8\nGoiz Argi\n,\nFermin Calbeton Kalea, 4\n(\nOld Town (Parte Vieja)\n).\nPintxos bar with the delicious\nbrocheta de gambas\n(fried prawns with a special vinaigrette),\nbola de carne\n(meat ball with red pepper) and a lot of cold pintxos with anchovies, mushrooms, cod, salmon, etc. Any of wine by glasses is good.\n(\nupdated Feb 2023\n)\n43.322689\n-1.984642\n9\nJuantxo Taberna\n,\nEnbeltran Kalea, 6\n(\nOld Town (Parte Vieja)\n).\nBest, cheapest 'bocadillo de tortilla de patatas' in Parte Vieja.

In Valle Gran Rey there are three mountain bike tour operators and bike rentals available in the villages of La Playa, La Puntilla and Vueltas.\nBe careful when riding down as the roads are steep and have tight bends. There are also two tunnels when coming down to Valle Gran Rey. The second and longer one can be circumvented by using the old road instead which goes by the mountainside. It starts on the right hand side of the tunnel entrance. However,\nextreme care is required\nas the railings on the old road are not in good condition (or missing altogether in places) and there are also big rocks and other debris on the road. When you drive in the tunnels make sure you have a headlight and a backlight (or at least a red reflector) so that cars can see you well ahead. Never ride without a well-fitting helmet."

    "text": "Eat\n[\nedit\n]\nAs with all cities which welcome large numbers of tourists, Barcelona's cuisine is inconsistent in quality, but there are plenty of restaurants serving excellent food at very reasonable prices, if you know where to look. The usual rules of thumb apply: to save money and get better food, look for places off the beaten track used by fellow travellers, and seek out cafés and restaurants which the locals frequent. In practice, this usually involves searching out eateries in residential districts away from the main sightseeing attractions. Avoid restaurants with touts outside, and have a basic understanding of the traditional foods served in restaurants, as well as the local drinks. One slightly crafty way of sussing a place's authenticity at a glance is to take note of how they spell a certain word: a menu board advertising\ntap\na\ns\n, written the Spanish/international way, is likely to be somewhere which primarily caters to tourists, whereas somewhere offering\ntap\ne\ns\n, using Catalan spelling, is in all probability a venue frequented by locals.\nSome districts to check out include\nGràcia\n, which is a hub of quality, affordable Catalan cooking of both the traditional and more avant-garde varieties, and the\nEixample\n, whose chic boulevards have upscale restaurants aplenty worthy of your splurge money. The fishing quarter of Barceloneta (in\nCiutat Vella\n) is an example of a neighbourhood where it pays to be picky: closer to the gentrified seafront, a slew of mojito beach bar-style places serve up expensive tourist tapas; for the real thing, head into the backstreets, where many traditional bars are still tucked away. In all cases, be prepared to \"promenade\" in search of the most attractive-looking menu; that's what the locals do, after all.\nWhere to eat during siesta\nThe majority of restaurants and cafes are closed 16:00-20:00 for\nmigdiada\n. If you failed to plan for that, here are some places you can eat during this period:\ntapas in bars\ninternational chains\nfood stands in market halls\nSet menus (menú del migdia / menú del día)\nMost restaurants (and some bars) offer a\nmenú del migdia\n/\nmenú del día\n(menu of the day), which usually means a three course meal (a first plate often a salad or rice-based or pasta-based dish, a second plate usually a meat or fish, and a drink; plus a dessert or coffee), 3 or 4 options for each course, for €12 to €20, depending on the restaurant. The portions may be quite generous, or rather small. During the week, some smart restaurants offer lunch specials from 14:00 to 16:00. The savvy traveller will try the hip places for a fraction of the price during the day.\nIf you're looking for a place where everyone can choose their own meal, ask for restaurants that serve\nplatos combinados\n, which is the closest thing to an American/Northern European meal.\nSmoking\nis not permitted inside bars and restaurants since 2011, but it's usually allowed in terraces.\nDishes\n[\nedit\n]\nA plate of\ntapes\nYou can get food from any part of the world in Barcelona, but make sure you try some Catalan food.\nSee\nCatalan cuisine section in the Catalonia article\n.\nThe selection of\nseafood\nis consistently great, although not a lot of it is local (this part of the Mediterranean is pretty well fished-out).\nA treat to try that no travel guide mentions is\nwaffles\nsold at street stands. They will tempt you with their mouth watering smell and taste.\nTapas restaurants are now all over the city (although tapas originated in Andalusia in the south of Spain). Each Spanish region has its native tapas; signature 'Catalonia' tapas is delicious. Some Catalans eat a more French-style three course meal (appetizer, main dish and dessert) and would more likely go for a pre-meal beer/vermouth and some snacks (olives, chips, etc.); others go for a meal entirely of tapas.  This pre-meal snack is called 'fer el vermut' or 'making the vermouth'. As you travel to smaller towns in Catalonia outside of Barcelona, it is less likely that you will find tapas and more likely you'll see restaurants serving traditional Catalan food in three courses.\nBeyond Catalan food, there is no shortage of\ndurum\nor\nshawarma\nstands in Barcelona, offering tasty beef or chicken and salad in toasted flatbread for around €5. Gyros are delicious! You can also consider the\nAsian\nselection, with a lot of Chinese, Japanese and Indian restaurants. As with anywhere else, there are plenty of\nItalian\nrestaurants, while\nLatin American\nofferings, particularly Argentine and\nMexican\n, are well-represented too.\nFood tours\n[\nedit\n]\nIf you feel lost in the variety of food choices there are – Catalan, Basque, Spanish, and beyond – it may be helpful to do a food tour to quickly get oriented. Many independent tour operators run food and wine tours in the city.\nBarcelona Eat Local Food Tours\n,\nHurtado 28 Barcelona, 08022\n,\n☏\n+1 800 656 0713\n.\nA family-owned business that showcases the best of Catalan gastronomy in off-the-beaten districts of Barcelona.\n(\nupdated Apr 2017\n)\nAreas to eat\n[\nedit\n]\nDepending on where you are in the city, there may be restaurants galore, or none at all. The following areas tend to be restaurant \"hubs\", with a large variety of restaurants to choose from:\nBarceloneta\n: A popular quarter for locals, where you can try fish based dishes, such as\nPaella\n(a name that may hide many different kinds of rice concoctions) or\nArròs negre\n(\nBlack Rice\n), that takes its colour because it is made using squid ink. Barceloneta is a very good place to eat\ntapas\nas well.\nSant Antoni is the new addition to the culinary scene in Barcelona where old and trendy cuisine mingle.\nEixample Esquerra (between Gran Via and Mallorca)\nBarri Gòtic (especially for tapas)\n\"El Born\" (next to Barri Gòtic)\nAround Plaça Catalunya there are dozens of restaurants serving\ntapas\n. One should be careful with the tourist traps as the area is highly populated with tourists.\nFor budget eating you may choose \"menú del migdia\" in small bars on the Avinguda del Parallel for €9-11 per person. Be aware that sometimes the menu and the staff are only in Spanish.\nThe large cafes that line the Passeig de Gràcia and the Rambla Catalunya, just north of the Plaça Catalunya, offer a variety of acceptable tapas. This part of the town is quite touristy and a bit expensive.\nThis page uses the following price ranges for a typical meal\nfor one\n, including soft drink:\nBudget\nUp to €10\nMid-range\n€10–€25\nSplurge\n€25 and up\nGroceries\n[\nedit\n]\nIn several supermarkets you can find a wide stall with a great selection of ready-to-eat dishes. You can get a two-course lunch for less than €5.\nRestaurants\n[\nedit\n]\nIndividual listings can be found in Barcelona's\ndistrict\narticles\nComer y no Bombas\n(\nLocation is variable\n).\nShares free vegan food.\nJuice bars\n. More and more the city is being populated by bars that serve organic/vegan food and cold-pressed juices.\nEl Glop\n.\nThree locations, in\nEixample\nand\nGràcia\n. Excellent mid-range Catalan meals. Allow about €20 per person, although you could get out of there for half of that if you let the price dictate your choice of dishes."

Only get a couple of pintxos at a time as sometimes what looks really appealing, has been sitting on the bar the whole day and is past its use by date. Test the waters. Cold ones are displayed on the bar. Just ask the barman for your drink and pick the pintxos yourself. If you need a plate, just ask.\nHot ones must be ordered from the barman and they take a short time to be cooked. There is always a hot tapas menu hanging from the wall.\nWhen you are done eating your tapas and have finished your drink you ask the barman for the bill, and you have to tell him what you have eaten. It is very important to be honest, as it is a long tradition. Locals will be upset if they find people eating and not paying. Normally you don't eat many pintxos at one bar but move from bar to bar, drinking a beer (caña) or wine and eating one or two tapas. Then you move to another bar. Traditionally residents would have one or two pintxos in the early evening to stave off any hunger before a later sit-down meal, rather than making a meal out of a large number of pintxos.\nGenerally, if the barman asks you to show your plate to them before you start eating, you know the bar markets towards tourists and is sub par and more expensive that it should be. A good bar will ask you what you've eaten as you pay and you should see a chef working out the back.\nMost pintxo bars are to be found in the old town, particularly on the streets running parallel to Boulevard. Generally a pintxo will cost €2-3. At some bars the pintxos are all priced the same, at others the price depends on the pintxo. Pintxos (tapas) bars are thick in the\nParte Vieja\n(Old Town), but there are masses of other places nearby in the\nGros\nand\nCentro\nareas. Most bars charge by the toothpick or plate from €1-5.\nThe Jamon Iberico (usually seen hanging from the ceiling in whole leg portions) is ubiquitous, and equally good virtually everywhere. The calamari seems to be the same at every bar, don't order it again at a different pintxo bar if you didn't like it the first time.\nCook-by-order pintxos\n[\nedit\n]\nSome slightly pricier pintxo bars that don't have pre-cooked pintxos and only cook them on order (correspondingly, their pintxo are of higher quality)."

They will tempt you with their mouth watering smell and taste.\nTapas restaurants are now all over the city (although tapas originated in Andalusia in the south of Spain). Each Spanish region has its native tapas; signature 'Catalonia' tapas is delicious. Some Catalans eat a more French-style three course meal (appetizer, main dish and dessert) and would more likely go for a pre-meal beer/vermouth and some snacks (olives, chips, etc.); others go for a meal entirely of tapas.  This pre-meal snack is called 'fer el vermut' or 'making the vermouth'. As you travel to smaller towns in Catalonia outside of Barcelona, it is less likely that you will find tapas and more likely you'll see restaurants serving traditional Catalan food in three courses.\nBeyond Catalan food, there is no shortage of\ndurum\nor\nshawarma\nstands in Barcelona, offering tasty beef or chicken and salad in toasted flatbread for around €5. Gyros are delicious! You can also consider the\nAsian\nselection, with a lot of Chinese, Japanese and Indian restaurants. As with anywhere else, there are plenty of\nItalian\nrestaurants, while\nLatin American\nofferings, particularly Argentine and\nMexican\n, are well-represented too."

Laurisilva has a very special property in that it makes clouds into rain: Due to the pressing upwards of the trade winds, there are often clouds on the top of La Gomera; but the leaves of the trees of Laurisilva have pores that catch the small drops from the clouds. The surplus water absorbed is secreted so that the trees are raining, which increases precipitation from 50-100%. Of the remaining Laurisilva is 50% growing on La Gomera, which makes Garajonay unique from a nature conservation point of view. Laurisilva has in earlier periods covered large areas surrounding the Middle Sea, but disappeared due to climate changes. The National Visitor Centre at Juego de Bolas, above Las Rosas, has a selection of native and endemic plants, as well as various artesanal artifacts. There are plenty fine walking paths in Garajonay and the surrounding landscape.\nThere is also a botanic garden of sorts near Vallehermoso.

The island is divided into 31 municipalities, belonging to three regions with their own distinct climate, history, and appeal.\nMetropolitan region\n(\nAnaga Rural Park\n,\nSanta Cruz de Tenerife\n,\nLa Esperanza\n,\nSan Andrés\n,\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\n,\nTaganana\n,\nTegueste\n)\nThe northeast of the island is the most densely populated, and home to the only 2 cities on Tenerife, capital city\nSanta Cruz de Tenerife\nand historic capital\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\nwhich is a\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\n. The eastern tip of the island is covered by the\nAnaga Rural Park\n, a mountainous and very rural area.\nThe north\n(\nEl Sauzal\n,\nGarachico\n,\nIcod de los Vinos\n,\nLa Orotava\n,\nPuerto de la Cruz\n,\nTeide National Park\n,\nTeno Rural Park\n)\nDue to the influence of the northeastern tradewinds, the northern coast tends to be cooler, with somewhat unstable and cloudy, springlike weather. It is home to many of the islands cultural and historic treasures, and the\nEl Teide\nvolcano.\nThe south\n(\nCandelaria\n,\nCosta Adeje\n,\nEl Medáno\n,\nGranadilla de Abona\n,\nGuía de Isora\n,\nGüímar\n,\nLos Cristianos\n,\nLos Gigantes\n,\nMasca\n,\nPlaya de las Américas\n,\nSantiago del Teide\n,\nVilaflor\n)\nThe south coast has a hot arid climate, and it was not until the late 19th century that these areas started development. If you are looking for beaches and nightlife, the southern coast is the place to go, as sunshine is almost guarenteed. Otherwise, this is the least interesting part of the island. It lacks the heritage and charm of the north, and most of the towns are residential, modern concrete constructions with little architectural appeal. There are however some picturesque towns to discover in the east (\nGüímar\n,\nCandelaria\n) and\nVilaflor\non the southern slopes of\nEl Teide\n."

    "text": "Understand\n[\nedit\n]\nIglesia de la Concepción in Valverde\nBiosphere Reserve Isla de El Hierro\nIt is the westernmost island of\nSpain\n, and in pre-Columbian times it was considered the end of the known world, where the zero meridian went through. Longitudes for locations were given as degrees east of the\nFerro meridian\n. It was home to about 11,700 people in 2023, and covers 278 km².\nThe remoteness has meant that development has arrived later to El Hierro than for instance to the other Canary Islands. The island got an electrical grid in the 1970s, still in the 1980s there were hardly any cars, and most roads were paved only in the 21st century. The shortcut between the island's two biggest villages, the 2,240 m long Los Roquillos tunnel was built in 2003. As such, visiting the island can feel like going back in time.\nIn 2000, El Hierro was declared a Biosphere Reserve (the status was upgraded to geopark in 2014) by UNESCO which implies that most of the fauna and flora are protected. Also the coast is included in the Reserve, all the underwater life is protected. But being a Biosphere Reserve has some inconveniences, like the prohibition of camping or collecting fruits and fish from the nature.\nTalk\n[\nedit\n]\nThe main language is\nCastilian Spanish\n, more exactly Canarian Spanish. As the Canary Islands have been a tourist destination for a long time, you can mostly get by in English.\nFlora and fauna\n[\nedit\n]\nEl Hierro's size and geography supports entirely endemic species including the critically endangered El Hierro giant lizard (Gallotia simonyi), for which there is a captive breeding programme, allowing its reintroduction.\nThe non-barren parts of the interior rely on relief precipitation, not much more than the average of 19 rainfall days per year, high relative humidity and geothermal springs. This non-arid parts have thermophilous (geothermal heat-liking) juniper clumps and a pine forest with other evergreens. Several species of lesser known beaked whales live around the island.\nLandscape\n[\nedit\n]\nEl Golfo, Frontera and el Campanario\nLike the rest of the Canary Islands chain, El Hierro is volcanic and sharply mountainous. The highest summit is Pico de Malpaso, 1501 m ASL. One eruption has to date been recorded on the island: from the Volcan de Lomo Negro vent in 1793, lasting a month. Between 2011 and 2012 a volcano was bubbling in the ocean south of El Hierro. Except as landscaped at its harbour towns the shore is rocky and in places precipitous.\nAcross the island goes the Cumbre, a forested volcanic mountain range. In the northeast is another plateau, in the northwest the El Golfo valley and in the southwest the slopes of El Julán. The landscape shows great contrasts: on one hand much of the island is high above the sea and steep cliffs make up most of the coastline, though on the other hand the highland is quite even and composed of fertile farmland.\nClimate\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nCanary Islands#Climate\nEl Hierro\nClimate chart (\nexplanation\n)\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\n27\n21\n17\n25\n21\n17\n20\n21\n17\n14\n22\n17\n3\n23\n19\n2\n24\n20\n0\n25\n21\n1\n26\n22\n3\n27\n22\n17\n26\n22\n31\n24\n20\n42\n22\n18\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °C\nPrecipitation\n+\nSnow\ntotals in mm\nImperial conversion\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\n1.1\n70\n63\n1\n70\n63\n0.8\n70\n63\n0.6\n72\n63\n0.1\n73\n66\n0.1\n75\n68\n0\n77\n70\n0\n79\n72\n0.1\n81\n72\n0.7\n79\n72\n1.2\n75\n68\n1.7\n72\n64\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °F\nPrecipitation\n+\nSnow\ntotals in inches\nThe climate is generally defined as semi-arid, however it varies a lot for such a small island. The higher inland has a subtropical Mediterranean climate, whereas the coasts have a desert or semi-arid climate.\nThe island's Atlantic location makes it the first breaker of the trade winds, and due to this fog and abundant cloudiness is common in the island's northern part, especially in the capital Valverde and its surroundings.

    "text": "Landscape\n[\nedit\n]\nEl Golfo, Frontera and el Campanario\nLike the rest of the Canary Islands chain, El Hierro is volcanic and sharply mountainous. The highest summit is Pico de Malpaso, 1501 m ASL. One eruption has to date been recorded on the island: from the Volcan de Lomo Negro vent in 1793, lasting a month. Between 2011 and 2012 a volcano was bubbling in the ocean south of El Hierro. Except as landscaped at its harbour towns the shore is rocky and in places precipitous.\nAcross the island goes the Cumbre, a forested volcanic mountain range. In the northeast is another plateau, in the northwest the El Golfo valley and in the southwest the slopes of El Julán. The landscape shows great contrasts: on one hand much of the island is high above the sea and steep cliffs make up most of the coastline, though on the other hand the highland is quite even and composed of fertile farmland."

Spanish citizens and EU nationals (if their state issues them) need only their national ID cards, or DNI, but non-EU citizens will require their passports to return. Just because you are not leaving the country of Spain doesn't mean you shouldn't carry your passport.\nThe increased border security may result in minor waiting time. This could be longer if you travel in summer when the main holiday season in Spain and\nFrance\nstarts and lots of families return to their homes in\nMorocco\n. There seem to be separate queues for Moroccans and foreigners at many border crossings, ports, and security checks. If you find yourself stuck in an extremely slow moving queue and do not look Moroccan, try getting noticed by an officer.

From Fnideq take a grand taxi to the border (5 dirham).\nFrom\nTangier\n's bus station there are a half dozen direct buses to Fnideq (operated by Tingis Transport company), otherwise you'll have to make a detour via Tetouan.\nCrossing the border\n[\nedit\n]\nYou will need\na passport\nto cross\n35.871115\n-5.344544\n1\nthe border with Morocco\nin either direction and official ID to book passage between mainland\nSpain\nand Ceuta. Rules for immigration are the same as for Spain. Ferry ticket salesmen have been known to sell tickets without requiring the proper identification, but security at the port going from Ceuta back to Algeciras can be much more strict. Spanish citizens and EU nationals (if their state issues them) need only their national ID cards, or DNI, but non-EU citizens will require their passports to return. Just because you are not leaving the country of Spain doesn't mean you shouldn't carry your passport.\nThe increased border security may result in minor waiting time. This could be longer if you travel in summer when the main holiday season in Spain and\nFrance\nstarts and lots of families return to their homes in\nMorocco\n. There seem to be separate queues for Moroccans and foreigners at many border crossings, ports, and security checks. If you find yourself stuck in an extremely slow moving queue and do not look Moroccan, try getting noticed by an officer. You may be ushered past the queue and processed very quickly.\nIf you are travelling by bus or taxi, you may consider taking an infrequent bus from the border to the city walls or even a little further downtown, €0.85.\nLine #7\nterminates at the border.

Although the club has not yet achieved promotion to the ACB, it has been a constant contender in the LEB Oro, regularly participating in the playoffs and demonstrating a high level of play. Additionally, Melilla Baloncesto has been successful in developing young players and providing a platform for talents who have later excelled in other competitions. Similar to football, matchups against other LEB Oro teams, such as Club Ourense Baloncesto or Cáceres Ciudad del Baloncesto, often generate significant excitement due to the rivalry and the competitive nature of both clubs in the league.\n(\nupdated Dec 2024\n)\nBullring of Melilla\n35.28918\n-2.94233\n3\nPlaza de Toros de Melilla\n.\nPlaza de Toros de Melilla, known as the \"Mosque of Bullfighting,\" is an important landmark of the city, inaugurated in 1942.

    "text": "Stay safe\n[\nedit\n]\nPickpockets\n[\nedit\n]\nPickpocketing\nis the most pressing issue for visitors to Barcelona.\nNever keep your wallet, cash or important documents\nin trouser pockets or in bag pockets: a money belt is an easy and inexpensive way to prevent being robbed. You will almost certainly be scoped out several times during your trip if you're in a tourist area or clearly don't fit in as a local, and it only takes a single momentary slip-up to lose your possessions. As always, be alert in crowded places, such as public transport, train and bus stations, La Rambla and Raval. If you are in a crowd, beware of anyone suspiciously or with no intention deliberately coming close to you.\nPickpockets usually work with more than one people, with one person using all kinds of tricks to distract you as their accomplices take action. The following are a few common methods:\nAt certain tourist hotspots, there are people who will try to show you a 'magic trick'. This involves tying a piece of string around your finger. While you are distracted (and your arm is effectively disabled), your wallet is stolen.\nA milky or unpleasant liquid might be thrown on you. Strangers will come out of nowhere to help you clean it up. If this happens, immediately walk away, you are being pickpocketed.\nEast Asian visitors are interrupted by touts, who will showcase their \"martial arts\" on you by kicking your leg. While you are distracted, you will have been pickpocketed.\nThese people may also pose as a person looking for spare change, policemen who wishes to check your wallet for ID, or as tourists asking for directions.\nMale travelers may be grabbed in the testicles by prostitutes or young female thieves. They will grab valuable possessions at the same time.\nIn the\nsubway\n, a group of men will come out of seemingly nowhere while you attempt to enter a subway car and block your entrance\nand\nexit in a coordinated manner, effectively pinning you against the doors. They will act as if the car is just crowded and they are trying to get on as well, but, in reality, they have already gone through your pockets. They will quickly return to the platform just as the doors are closing, making you effectively trapped in the departing train. A more serious crime includes a person deliberately jamming the entry gate by inserting his subway card just as you are about to pass. His accomplice tries to 'help' you as the others are on your back snatching your items.\nUnder no circumstances should you\nleave your items\nunattended. While you are eating outside, a guy may babble near you asking for change with an unreadable poster in his hands and getting closer and closer to your smartphone until he eventually picks it up and passes it to a second guy that will run away with it. If you have a backpack or bag, don't place it on the ground without wrapping the loops around your leg or attaching it to the table using an S-Hook. Do not ask your friends to watch your luggage, thieves see ripe targets in people carrying too many bags, and will grab a carry-on bag and run.\nIf you need a police report to make an insurance claim for your stolen possessions, you can\nfile a report online\nif you have no leads or witnesses. Police services generally expect you to provide a valid serial number to substantiate a theft allegation for electronic devices.\nScams\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nCommon scams\nPeople in Barcelona are often very friendly and love to practice their English, so don't be unfriendly. That said, you should be suspicious if someone approaches you in a touristy area speaking your language and asking you for help. This should put your guard up immediately. Do not be tempted to sign their petition, give them directions, or help them with their problem. You don't know anything about where you are, since you're a tourist, so you won't be able to help them in any case.\nProfessional scam artists exhibiting a high degree of coordination are active in many areas of the city. Be careful in tourist areas. A variety of\nmethods\nare employed, including the\nNo-change trick\n. A common scam involves fake cops who will show up ask to see your passport, then take your belongings at the first opportunity. The story varies, but they are almost certainly not real ones. When it happens, the best strategy is to just walk away instead of starting any sort of conversations with them. Another trick is that one seemingly confused person will ask you for directions, diverting your attention and then suddenly fake police will appear asking for your ID. This is a co-ordinated move to divert the attention and steal whatever is possible. If such incident happens, just walk away, without listening to any of their conversation.  Stay alert, especially in busy tourist area near the Sants station and Plaça d'Espanya.\nAnother popular scam happens in the metro. A group of scammers (often middle-aged women) will take advantage of the fuss while people are entering the metro and surround a tourist, frantically asking for directions. Most tourists won't know what to say while one of the scammers empties their pockets. They will try to confuse the tourist while the metro stays in the platform, and will get out just before the doors are closed. When you realize you've been scammed, the train will have already left and they will be safely outside with your belongings.\nThe bird excrement scam is also common. One or more accomplices will secretly spray or throw a smelly liquid on you. When you look up thinking a passing bird has pooped on you, they will run up to you and tell you that they saw a bird poop on you. They will offer to help you clean up, and while you are cleaning they will go through your pockets and any bags you have set down. It is wise to beware of anyone who is attempting to touch a complete stranger.\nA version of\nThree Card Monte\nis one of many common scams played on Les Rambles. There are also people holding petitions to install a wheelchair lift in locations with a lot of stairs. Once your signature is obtained they will then aggressively ask for a donation. Sometimes there can be crowds of children demanding money with hardly anyone else in the area, making it difficult to get away.\nBesides, in the square where the Barcelona Cathedral is located, there are female scammers who dress up as mimes (with their face painted white) to rob tourists, telling them that they are selling the balloons they carry or even asking them to take a picture together to grab their belongings. The best option is not to approach them and go away in case they approach you.\nViolent crimes\n[\nedit\n]\nIn 2019 there was a surge in violent crimes around Barcelona: in just the summer, there were almost as many violent deaths as there were for the whole previous year. While tourists are only occasionally targeted (and almost exclusively simple robberies), this should be not a going concern, many of these deaths are either drug-related or take place during drunken fights, so you are best advised to avoid such situations.\nFootball\n[\nedit\n]\nLocal club\nFC Barcelona\n(also known as \"Barça\", a term used by locals to refer strictly to the club and not the city) is seen as a symbol of Catalan nationalism, and has a very heated and politically-charged rivalry with Real Madrid, which is seen as a symbol of the Spanish state and ruling establishment, and violent confrontations between the supporters of both clubs have been known to occur. Avoid wearing Real Madrid shirts while you're in Barcelona, especially on matchdays, as that could result in you being singled out for violence by local fans. On the other hand, wearing an Atlético Madrid (the other Madrid club) shirt might get you some stares and some harmless teasing, but certainly no violent reactions.\nFurthermore, the local\nDerbi barceloní\nbetween FC Barcelona and Espanyol is also a politically-charged one, as FC Barcelona is traditionally supported by Catalan independence supporters, while Espanyol is traditionally supported by those who wish to remain part of Spain. If you hear Barça and Espanyol fans having an argument, be careful, as things can quickly escalate.\nATMs\n[\nedit\n]\nBarcelona offers ATMs in many locations. Many provide a wide range of services (withdrawals, transfers, mobile credit recharges, ticketing, etc.), and most accept ATM/debit/credit cards of various banks. Choose an ATM in a secure or highly-public space (e.g., in a bank lobby or airport terminal) to avoid machines modified by criminals to skim/video your card data or where you might be robbed after use.  Ensure early in usage that the ATM supports a language you understand. For a full discussion of safe/effective charge/debit/ATM card usage and their cost trade-offs, see also\nMoney\n. They will charge you a usage fee on top of anything your bank charges you which should be declared on the screen before you proceed (2,90€ for a 500€ withdrawal as of Oct. 2024 across different banks).\nAreas of caution\n[\nedit\n]\nBe very careful in the Barcelona Sants train station where thieves prey on new arrivals, even on the platforms. In general, try to stay away from suburban trains (\ncercanias\nin Spanish or\nrodalies\nin Catalan) late in the evening, as you may encounter young louts that disturb passengers, smoke, break windows and vandalize equipment. Don't rely too much on the railway security staff, as they prefer not to get involved, and by all means avoid messing with those troublemakers.\nWomen travelling alone should exercise caution while exploring the more isolated parts of Montjuïc. The city beaches, particularly the ones adjoining Barceloneta, have proven to be quite lucrative for bag snatchers. Anything that you would rather not lose is best left, locked, in your accommodation\nMen traveling alone should expect the prostitutes on Les Rambles, St. Antoni, and Raval in the early hours to be very aggressive and in league with pickpockets and robbers.\nAlso, people need to be careful when leaving the bars of the Olympic Port late as there are many pickpockets around.\nBe wary of wearing exposed jewelry such as gold chains and necklaces. People walking down a street may be attacked from behind by a snatch-and-run thief. Be especially careful of seedy looking men on bicycles, as snatch-and-run assaults can occur.\nIn the event of such a robbery, you will need to find the local police station to report the incident, especially if you are going to make a travel insurance claim. Don't expect any police action beyond the report, though, as these types of events are par for the course and arrests, even when made, almost never lead to prosecution due to a slow, antiquated, and overburdened legal system.\nParts of Barcelona are covered by closed circuit TV surveillance, but only the more popular spots.\nAnti-tourism movement\n[\nedit\n]\nMany Barcelona residents have the impression that there are too many tourists in Barcelona and that it has increased living costs, as landlords prefer to rent to tourists and not to locals to make more profit. Also, a lot of local shops have closed to make way for souvenir spots, so many locals feel they are being expelled from areas they have lived their whole life. In some areas, particularly the ones next to the beach where drunken tourists often stroll in swimming suits, there were anti-tourism demonstrations by locals, which had the backing of the Mayor of Barcelona. After nearly disappearing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, these riots have returned in 2024.\nCars\n[\nedit\n]\nTourist drivers may attract special attention, such as\nRed light bag snatch\nor\nFlat tire scams\nPublic transportation\n[\nedit\n]\nBesides being a particular pickpocket hot spot, there are plenty of fare evaders who will stick to you when crossing a fare barrier. Do not even attempt to block their way and let them pass, as many of them can be quite aggressive. Although stations are full of surveillance cameras, they are seldom used to either enforce fare payment or as a proof for filed assault charges, except in the most severe cases. Lack of staff in many stations and few ticket inspections effectively mean\ncarte blanche\nfor them. The fare evasion fine is just €50 if paid on spot, no matter how many times the culprit has previously been caught, and many fines remain unpaid because payment enforcement is legally cumbersome.\nReporting crimes\n[\nedit\n]\nIf you need to report a crime (for example, to claim on travel insurance), be prepared for the reality that in the downtown police station, officers generally do not speak English, even though the theft report form is in English, Spanish, and Catalan. The police station most often used to report theft is the one underneath Plaça Catalunya beside metro station, where they have some translators for common languages."

This popular dish is widely eaten throughout central Spain.\nSopa de ajo\n– Garlic soup is a rich and oily soup which generally includes paprika, grated Spanish ham, fried bread and a poached egg. A variation of this soup is known as\nsopa castellana\n.\nIt is ironic that Madrid, in the centre of Spain, has higher quality seafood than many coastal regions. This quality comes at a price, and most Spaniards only occasionally shell out for a\nmariscada\nor seafood feast. Experiencing Madrid's seafood may be, for the visitor, an experience which will be worth the cost.\nFresh meat and meat products (jamón ibérico, morcilla, chorizo etc.) are of generally a very high quality in Madrid.\nRestaurants\n[\nedit\n]\nMany of the restaurants and\ncervecerías\nin the Sol and Plaza Mayor area have generic poster board advertisements on the sidewalks with pictures advertising various paella dishes. These paellas are usually of bad quality and should be avoided. If you are looking for good, authentic Spanish paella, it is usually best to find a more expensive, 'sit-down' type of restaurant that offers a variety of paella dishes.\nA much better option is the La Latina neighbourhood just south of Plaza Mayor, especially along Calle Cava Baja. There are also a number of deli-like shops along Calle Arenal that offer food to go (\npara llevar\n).\nAt bars, one generally orders various sized plates, a\nración\nmeaning a full dish, a\nmedia ración\nor a half-dish, or a smaller version which would be a\ntapa\n, a\npinxto\nor a\npincho\n.\nThe Spaniards don't eat lunch until 14:00 or 15:00, and dinner doesn't start until 21:00 or 22:00. As a rule of thumb, restaurants serve lunch from 13:00 until 15:30, then close and re-open for dinner at 20:00, serving until 23:00. This schedule is usually for restaurants, since bars and\nmesones\nare usually opened all day long offering a wide variety of tapas and sandwiches for a cheap price. If you're really desperate, the standard bunch of fast food chains do stay open throughout the day.\nMuseo del Jamón\nChurros at Chocolatería San Ginés"

Spanish citizens and EU nationals (if their state issues them) need only their national ID cards, or DNI, but non-EU citizens will require their passports to return. Just because you are not leaving the country of Spain doesn't mean you shouldn't carry your passport.\nThe increased border security may result in minor waiting time. This could be longer if you travel in summer when the main holiday season in Spain and\nFrance\nstarts and lots of families return to their homes in\nMorocco\n. There seem to be separate queues for Moroccans and foreigners at many border crossings, ports, and security checks. If you find yourself stuck in an extremely slow moving queue and do not look Moroccan, try getting noticed by an officer.

    "text": "Pickpockets\n[\nedit\n]\nPickpocketing\nis the most pressing issue for visitors to Barcelona.\nNever keep your wallet, cash or important documents\nin trouser pockets or in bag pockets: a money belt is an easy and inexpensive way to prevent being robbed. You will almost certainly be scoped out several times during your trip if you're in a tourist area or clearly don't fit in as a local, and it only takes a single momentary slip-up to lose your possessions. As always, be alert in crowded places, such as public transport, train and bus stations, La Rambla and Raval. If you are in a crowd, beware of anyone suspiciously or with no intention deliberately coming close to you.\nPickpockets usually work with more than one people, with one person using all kinds of tricks to distract you as their accomplices take action. The following are a few common methods:\nAt certain tourist hotspots, there are people who will try to show you a 'magic trick'. This involves tying a piece of string around your finger. While you are distracted (and your arm is effectively disabled), your wallet is stolen.\nA milky or unpleasant liquid might be thrown on you. Strangers will come out of nowhere to help you clean it up. If this happens, immediately walk away, you are being pickpocketed.\nEast Asian visitors are interrupted by touts, who will showcase their \"martial arts\" on you by kicking your leg. While you are distracted, you will have been pickpocketed.\nThese people may also pose as a person looking for spare change, policemen who wishes to check your wallet for ID, or as tourists asking for directions.\nMale travelers may be grabbed in the testicles by prostitutes or young female thieves. They will grab valuable possessions at the same time.\nIn the\nsubway\n, a group of men will come out of seemingly nowhere while you attempt to enter a subway car and block your entrance\nand\nexit in a coordinated manner, effectively pinning you against the doors. They will act as if the car is just crowded and they are trying to get on as well, but, in reality, they have already gone through your pockets. They will quickly return to the platform just as the doors are closing, making you effectively trapped in the departing train. A more serious crime includes a person deliberately jamming the entry gate by inserting his subway card just as you are about to pass. His accomplice tries to 'help' you as the others are on your back snatching your items.\nUnder no circumstances should you\nleave your items\nunattended. While you are eating outside, a guy may babble near you asking for change with an unreadable poster in his hands and getting closer and closer to your smartphone until he eventually picks it up and passes it to a second guy that will run away with it. If you have a backpack or bag, don't place it on the ground without wrapping the loops around your leg or attaching it to the table using an S-Hook. Do not ask your friends to watch your luggage, thieves see ripe targets in people carrying too many bags, and will grab a carry-on bag and run.\nIf you need a police report to make an insurance claim for your stolen possessions, you can\nfile a report online\nif you have no leads or witnesses. Police services generally expect you to provide a valid serial number to substantiate a theft allegation for electronic devices."

The entry fee is normally €15 (including one drink) but you can get in for free before 03:00 if you ask for a VIP pass at a bar beforehand (Bar Tas Tas is a good place for that). This club has an amazing terrace out back to relax after you've had one drink too many (drinks cost around €8 a pop, by the way, €5 for a beer). All year round, the club is filled with local people, tourists and exchange students."

    "text": "Scams\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nCommon scams\nPeople in Barcelona are often very friendly and love to practice their English, so don't be unfriendly. That said, you should be suspicious if someone approaches you in a touristy area speaking your language and asking you for help. This should put your guard up immediately. Do not be tempted to sign their petition, give them directions, or help them with their problem. You don't know anything about where you are, since you're a tourist, so you won't be able to help them in any case.\nProfessional scam artists exhibiting a high degree of coordination are active in many areas of the city. Be careful in tourist areas. A variety of\nmethods\nare employed, including the\nNo-change trick\n. A common scam involves fake cops who will show up ask to see your passport, then take your belongings at the first opportunity. The story varies, but they are almost certainly not real ones. When it happens, the best strategy is to just walk away instead of starting any sort of conversations with them. Another trick is that one seemingly confused person will ask you for directions, diverting your attention and then suddenly fake police will appear asking for your ID. This is a co-ordinated move to divert the attention and steal whatever is possible. If such incident happens, just walk away, without listening to any of their conversation.  Stay alert, especially in busy tourist area near the Sants station and Plaça d'Espanya.\nAnother popular scam happens in the metro. A group of scammers (often middle-aged women) will take advantage of the fuss while people are entering the metro and surround a tourist, frantically asking for directions. Most tourists won't know what to say while one of the scammers empties their pockets. They will try to confuse the tourist while the metro stays in the platform, and will get out just before the doors are closed. When you realize you've been scammed, the train will have already left and they will be safely outside with your belongings.\nThe bird excrement scam is also common. One or more accomplices will secretly spray or throw a smelly liquid on you. When you look up thinking a passing bird has pooped on you, they will run up to you and tell you that they saw a bird poop on you. They will offer to help you clean up, and while you are cleaning they will go through your pockets and any bags you have set down. It is wise to beware of anyone who is attempting to touch a complete stranger.\nA version of\nThree Card Monte\nis one of many common scams played on Les Rambles. There are also people holding petitions to install a wheelchair lift in locations with a lot of stairs. Once your signature is obtained they will then aggressively ask for a donation. Sometimes there can be crowds of children demanding money with hardly anyone else in the area, making it difficult to get away.\nBesides, in the square where the Barcelona Cathedral is located, there are female scammers who dress up as mimes (with their face painted white) to rob tourists, telling them that they are selling the balloons they carry or even asking them to take a picture together to grab their belongings. The best option is not to approach them and go away in case they approach you."

In the early 8th century CE the Moors invaded, and\nBalansiyya\nbecame the capital of the Muslim Taifa of Valencia, thriving as a trading centre for paper, silk, ceramics, glass, and silver. With a brief interlude of Christian control in the 11th century under El Cid, the city remained in Muslim hands until the Christian Reconquista led by King Jaime I of Aragon in 1238, and was incorporated as a kingdom under the Crown of Aragon.\nValencia experienced its golden age in the 15th century, with a growing population and flowering of Valencian culture and the arts. Significant monuments from this period include the cathedral’s\nMicalet\n, the UNESCO-listed\nLlotja de la Seda\n, and the\nTorres de Serrano\n(\nSerrano Tower\n). During this period it became one of the most influential cities of the Mediterranean, and helped to fund Christopher Columbus's first voyages to the Americas.\nIn 1609 the Spanish government ordered the expulsion of all Jews and Moriscos from the kingdom to north Africa. Muslim descendants made up about a third of the population of Valencia and the surrounding region, and their forced removal brought about a major economic downturn, and in some nearby communities, economic collapse. It was more than a century before the city began to recover.\nIn the 20th century, Valencia was the capital of Republican Spain from 1936 to 1939, and during the Spanish Civil War sustained heavy bombardment by Franco’s forces, both by air and sea. Franco retaliated for Valencia’s Republican past with cultural and ideological repression, and forbade the use of the Valencian language. In 1957 the Túria River overflowed its banks leading to catastrophic flooding of the old city centre with more than 80 dead. The river was consequently diverted to the south of the city, but it was not until the return of democracy that the original abandoned riverbed was finally converted into a park – now one of the city’s most outstanding features.\nIn the 21st century Valencia has continued to evolve. In 2007 and 2010 the city hosted the\nAmerica’s Cup\n, and from 2008 to 2012 hosted the\nFormula One European Grand Prix\n. Architecturally, too, the city has changed, most notably with the construction of the\nCiutat de les Arts i les Ciències\n(\nCity of Arts and Sciences\n) by internationally-renowned Valencian architect Santiago Calatrava. The 2015 election of a new leftist coalition city council, after decades of control by the conservative\nPartido Popular\n(PP), brought renewed focus on expanding and improving existing infrastructure, including adding three new metro lines and expanding the city’s already extensive bicycle path network. This ongoing transformation has turned a once little-considered medium city into a meatier and more interesting destination.\nVisitor information\n[\nedit\n]\nTourist Info Valencia\n.\nAll offices sell the\nValencia Tourist Card\n, which is available for 24, 48, or 72 hours, and allows free public transportation (including the metro to/from the airport), free admission to museums and monuments, and discounts at some shops, restaurants, and tourist services.

The Northern part of the Costa Blanca features sea side towns and resorts such as Dénia, Jávea and Moraira to the far north. Further south larger resorts like Altea, Calpe, Benidorm, Alicante and Torrevieja attract millions of tourists annually.\nCosta Blanca is decidedly a spectacular part of Spain in terms of nature, beaches and culture. With clean and immaculate beaches dipping into the crystal clear Mediterranean sea, flat fertile valleys and plenty of charming villages buzzing with traditional Spanish cultural events.\nWhite sandy beaches, pleasant resorts and relatively cheap accommodation are the main features of the Costa Blanca from a traveler's perspective. The area is further blessed with stunning nature, hidden coves, the odd golf course and graciously adapted domestic areas. The grand mountain ranges provides vivid scenery to this gorgeous area and the ancient villages scattered along the coast has plenty of authentic Spanish life to be explored. The popularity of the Costa Blanca as a holiday destination is easy to comprehend."

Until about 03:00, a very young crowd, and if you′re around here before midnight, and over the age of 20, prepare to feel positively old. Most places close around 03:00, then people move to clubs in Gran Vía or Tribunal to continue partying.\nChueca\n- Near Malasaña and Gran Vía, it is known as the gay district, but doesn't exclude straight people. Pop and electronic music. By far, the most cosmopolitan place in town. Has become quite chic and expensive.\nTribunal/Malasaña\n- Alternative area. Mainly rock and pop music clubs, some of them still open from \"La movida madrileña\" (beginning of the 1980s). Calle Manuela Malasaña is a great place to eat, Calle del Pez a great place to have some drinks and Plaza Dos de Mayo is the heart of the district.\nGran Vía\n- \"The place that never sleeps\". Major street that includes many popular nightclubs, usually open from 01:00 to 06:00-07:00.\nLa Latina\n- Near Lavapiés, it is the place to go for tapas and full of bohemian young people looking for stylish bars. In the old section are many small bars and pubs catering to people in their late 20s and 30s). Multiple bars serving fantastic tapas in the Cava Baja and Cuchilleros.\nLavapiés\n- Multicultural quarter of the city, with more than 50% foreign residents, mostly from Africa, Asia and Latin America. Plenty of world music bars. Lavapiés is maybe the most cosmopolitan and hippy area at the same time in Madrid.\nMoncloa/Ciudad Universitaria\n- Due to its proximity to\nUniversidad Complutense\n, Moncloa is associated with students and a student lifestyle, with many cheap bars and discos. Some of the places are best avoided. There are a few cheap bars with great nightlife starting from Thursdays directly in the Ciudad Universitaria near the major student dorms.\nTorre Europa\n- There used to be several posh pubs and clubs under the tower across from the stadium. There are four or five bars and discos in the avenida de Brazil area catering to a young and student crowd."

Avoid wearing Real Madrid shirts while you're in Barcelona, especially on matchdays, as that could result in you being singled out for violence by local fans. On the other hand, wearing an Atlético Madrid (the other Madrid club) shirt might get you some stares and some harmless teasing, but certainly no violent reactions.\nFurthermore, the local\nDerbi barceloní\nbetween FC Barcelona and Espanyol is also a politically-charged one, as FC Barcelona is traditionally supported by Catalan independence supporters, while Espanyol is traditionally supported by those who wish to remain part of Spain.

It has one of the largest economies in Africa, and is an important player in Arab affairs, .\nName transcriptions\n[\nedit\n]\nArabic\n:\nالمملكة المغربية\n,\nal-mamlaka al-maḡribiyya\nBerber\n:\nⵜⴰⴳⵍⴷⵉⵜ ⵏ ⵍⵎⵖⵔⵉⴱ\n,\nTageldit n lmeɣrib\nFrench\n:\nRoyaume du Maroc\nHistory\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nIslamic Golden Age\nThe earliest known independent state of Morocco was the\nBerber Kingdom of Mauretania\nunder King Baga. This kingdom dates back at least to 300 BCE.\nFrom the 1st century BCE, Morocco was part of the\nRoman Empire\nas\nMauretania Tingitana\n. Christianity was introduced in the 2nd century CE and gained converts in the Roman towns, among slaves and Berber farmers.\nIn the 5th century CE, as the Roman Empire declined, the region was invaded from the north by the Vandals and later the Visigoths. In the 6th century, northern Morocco became part of the Byzantine Empire. Throughout this time, however, the Berber inhabitants in the high mountains of the interior remained independent.\nIn 670 CE, the first Islamic conquest of the North African coastal plain took place under Uqba ibn Nafi, a general serving under the Umayyads. The indigenous Berber tribes adopted\nIslam\n, but retained their customary laws. They also paid taxes and tribute to the new Muslim administration. The first independent Muslim state in the area of modern Morocco was the Kingdom of Nekor, an emirate in the Rif Mountains. It was founded by Salih I ibn Mansur in 710, as a client state. After the outbreak of the Berber Revolt in 739, the Berbers formed other independent states such as the\nMiknasa\nof Sijilmasa and the\nBarghawata\n.\nAccording to medieval legend, Idris Ibn Abdallah fled to Morocco after the Abbasids' massacre of the tribes in Iraq. He convinced the Awraba tribes to break the allegiance to distant Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad and he founded the\nIdrisid Dynasty\nin 788. The Idrisids established Fez as their capital and Morocco became a centre of Muslim learning and major regional power. The Idrisids were ousted in 927 by the Fatimid Caliphate and their Miknasa allies. After Miknasa broke off relations with the Fatimids in 932, they were removed from power by the Maghrawa of Sijilmasa in 980. From the 11th century to the early 20th century onwards, a series of dynasties including the\nAlmoravids\n,\nAlmohads\n,\nMarinids\n,\nWattasids\n,\nSaadis\nand\nAlaouites\nruled Morocco until it was controlled by the Spanish and French.\nDuring World War II, Morocco became an Axis puppet under Vichy France in 1940, and became a refuge for affluent Europeans, famous through the film\nCasablanca\n. Morocco was liberated in 1942 by American troops in Operation Torch (see\nWorld War II in Africa\n) and hosted the 1943 Casablanca conference.\nMorocco's long struggle for independence from France ended in 1956. The internationalized city of Tangier was turned over to the new country that same year. Morocco annexed\nWestern Sahara\nduring the late 1970s, and even though the status of the territory remains unresolved, all maps in Morocco show Western Sahara as an integrated part of Morocco.\nGradual political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature in 1997, although the king still possesses the actual political power. The press is mostly state controlled even though there are free newspapers, and clampdowns have occurred following criticism of the authorities or articles concerning the Western Sahara situation.\nCulture\n[\nedit\n]\nMorocco has 34 million inhabitants. It's a good place to see varied cultural heritages including those with African, Arabic, Berber, Moorish and Western influences. Islam is by far the dominant religion, with 99% of the population being at least nominally Muslim. Christianity is the second largest religion, but most Christians in Morocco are expatriates from Western countries. Morocco used to have a large Jewish community, most of whom were Sephardic Jews whose ancestors fled the Spanish and Portuguese inquisitions, though the vast majority of them fled to Israel in the second half of the 20th century, and only a small community remains in Morocco today. Nevertheless, Morocco's Jewish community is the largest remaining one in an Arab country.\nElectricity and voltage\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nElectrical systems\nThe voltage in Morocco is generally\n220 V\n(partly 127 V) 50 Hz, and outlets will fit the two-pin plug known as the\nEuroplug\n, probably the most commonly used international plug and included in most international plug adapter kits. It is ungrounded and designed for at most 2.5 A.\nAmerican and Canadian appliances, which are built to use 110 V, may be damaged if they're plugged into a 220 V unless your appliance is \"dual-voltage\" (designed for both 110 and 220 V). If not, you'll need a\ntransformer\nor\nconverter\n(depending on the device) as well as an adapter.\nHolidays\n[\nedit\n]\nThe biggest event on the Moroccan calendar is the month of\nRamadan\n, during which Muslims fast during the day time and break the fast at sunset. Most restaurants are closed for lunch (with the exception of those catering specifically to tourists), and things generally slow down. Travelling during this time is entirely possible, and the restrictions don't apply to non-Muslims, but it's respectful to refrain from eating, drinking or smoking in public during the fast. At the end of the month is the holiday of\nEid al-Fitr\n, when practically everything closes for as long as a week and transport is packed as everybody heads back home. Alcohol consumption is not prohibited for tourists during Ramadan; there are a few restaurants and bars serving alcohol. Also, alcohol can be purchased in a supermarket, but only if a tourist shows their passport to the staff, as Moroccans are not allowed to buy or consume alcohol during the holy month.\nVisitor information\n[\nedit\n]\nVisit Morocco\nIf you are adventurous at heart, a good time to visit Morocco for trekking in the desert is February. You can enjoy coastal areas or beaches at Essaouira in July. April is the best time to visit the imperial towns in Morocco. The peak tourist season in Morocco is July and August."

    "text": "Areas of caution\n[\nedit\n]\nBe very careful in the Barcelona Sants train station where thieves prey on new arrivals, even on the platforms. In general, try to stay away from suburban trains (\ncercanias\nin Spanish or\nrodalies\nin Catalan) late in the evening, as you may encounter young louts that disturb passengers, smoke, break windows and vandalize equipment. Don't rely too much on the railway security staff, as they prefer not to get involved, and by all means avoid messing with those troublemakers.\nWomen travelling alone should exercise caution while exploring the more isolated parts of Montjuïc. The city beaches, particularly the ones adjoining Barceloneta, have proven to be quite lucrative for bag snatchers. Anything that you would rather not lose is best left, locked, in your accommodation\nMen traveling alone should expect the prostitutes on Les Rambles, St. Antoni, and Raval in the early hours to be very aggressive and in league with pickpockets and robbers.\nAlso, people need to be careful when leaving the bars of the Olympic Port late as there are many pickpockets around.\nBe wary of wearing exposed jewelry such as gold chains and necklaces. People walking down a street may be attacked from behind by a snatch-and-run thief. Be especially careful of seedy looking men on bicycles, as snatch-and-run assaults can occur.\nIn the event of such a robbery, you will need to find the local police station to report the incident, especially if you are going to make a travel insurance claim. Don't expect any police action beyond the report, though, as these types of events are par for the course and arrests, even when made, almost never lead to prosecution due to a slow, antiquated, and overburdened legal system.\nParts of Barcelona are covered by closed circuit TV surveillance, but only the more popular spots."

Also, a lot of local shops have closed to make way for souvenir spots, so many locals feel they are being expelled from areas they have lived their whole life. In some areas, particularly the ones next to the beach where drunken tourists often stroll in swimming suits, there were anti-tourism demonstrations by locals, which had the backing of the Mayor of Barcelona. After nearly disappearing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, these riots have returned in 2024."

Even though it is similar to the Catalan spoken in Catalonia, Valencians are very particular about their language being referred to as \"Valencian\", and often find it offensive when people refer to it as \"Catalan\". In the capital of Valencia, which is the third largest city in Spain, not many people speak Valencian, nor are they offended if addressed in Spanish. However, outside the capital, Valencian is often preferred. As in\nBarcelona\nwith Catalan, it helps to be sensitive to this language dynamic. However, the linguistic issue is not as controversial as in Barcelona and most people in Valencia speak Spanish as their first and often their only language. Road directional signs are generally bilingual in Spanish and Valencian.\nThe English-speaking skills of the locals can be hit or miss. Most people under 50 speak some English and some quite a bit, but most would prefer being addressed at first in Spanish or Valencian. French is also spoken or understood by some."

Until about 03:00, a very young crowd, and if you′re around here before midnight, and over the age of 20, prepare to feel positively old. Most places close around 03:00, then people move to clubs in Gran Vía or Tribunal to continue partying.\nChueca\n- Near Malasaña and Gran Vía, it is known as the gay district, but doesn't exclude straight people. Pop and electronic music. By far, the most cosmopolitan place in town. Has become quite chic and expensive.\nTribunal/Malasaña\n- Alternative area. Mainly rock and pop music clubs, some of them still open from \"La movida madrileña\" (beginning of the 1980s). Calle Manuela Malasaña is a great place to eat, Calle del Pez a great place to have some drinks and Plaza Dos de Mayo is the heart of the district.\nGran Vía\n- \"The place that never sleeps\". Major street that includes many popular nightclubs, usually open from 01:00 to 06:00-07:00.\nLa Latina\n- Near Lavapiés, it is the place to go for tapas and full of bohemian young people looking for stylish bars. In the old section are many small bars and pubs catering to people in their late 20s and 30s). Multiple bars serving fantastic tapas in the Cava Baja and Cuchilleros.\nLavapiés\n- Multicultural quarter of the city, with more than 50% foreign residents, mostly from Africa, Asia and Latin America. Plenty of world music bars. Lavapiés is maybe the most cosmopolitan and hippy area at the same time in Madrid.\nMoncloa/Ciudad Universitaria\n- Due to its proximity to\nUniversidad Complutense\n, Moncloa is associated with students and a student lifestyle, with many cheap bars and discos. Some of the places are best avoided. There are a few cheap bars with great nightlife starting from Thursdays directly in the Ciudad Universitaria near the major student dorms.\nTorre Europa\n- There used to be several posh pubs and clubs under the tower across from the stadium. There are four or five bars and discos in the avenida de Brazil area catering to a young and student crowd."

    "text": "History\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nIslamic Golden Age\nThe earliest known independent state of Morocco was the\nBerber Kingdom of Mauretania\nunder King Baga. This kingdom dates back at least to 300 BCE.\nFrom the 1st century BCE, Morocco was part of the\nRoman Empire\nas\nMauretania Tingitana\n. Christianity was introduced in the 2nd century CE and gained converts in the Roman towns, among slaves and Berber farmers.\nIn the 5th century CE, as the Roman Empire declined, the region was invaded from the north by the Vandals and later the Visigoths. In the 6th century, northern Morocco became part of the Byzantine Empire. Throughout this time, however, the Berber inhabitants in the high mountains of the interior remained independent.\nIn 670 CE, the first Islamic conquest of the North African coastal plain took place under Uqba ibn Nafi, a general serving under the Umayyads. The indigenous Berber tribes adopted\nIslam\n, but retained their customary laws. They also paid taxes and tribute to the new Muslim administration. The first independent Muslim state in the area of modern Morocco was the Kingdom of Nekor, an emirate in the Rif Mountains. It was founded by Salih I ibn Mansur in 710, as a client state. After the outbreak of the Berber Revolt in 739, the Berbers formed other independent states such as the\nMiknasa\nof Sijilmasa and the\nBarghawata\n.\nAccording to medieval legend, Idris Ibn Abdallah fled to Morocco after the Abbasids' massacre of the tribes in Iraq. He convinced the Awraba tribes to break the allegiance to distant Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad and he founded the\nIdrisid Dynasty\nin 788. The Idrisids established Fez as their capital and Morocco became a centre of Muslim learning and major regional power. The Idrisids were ousted in 927 by the Fatimid Caliphate and their Miknasa allies. After Miknasa broke off relations with the Fatimids in 932, they were removed from power by the Maghrawa of Sijilmasa in 980. From the 11th century to the early 20th century onwards, a series of dynasties including the\nAlmoravids\n,\nAlmohads\n,\nMarinids\n,\nWattasids\n,\nSaadis\nand\nAlaouites\nruled Morocco until it was controlled by the Spanish and French.\nDuring World War II, Morocco became an Axis puppet under Vichy France in 1940, and became a refuge for affluent Europeans, famous through the film\nCasablanca\n. Morocco was liberated in 1942 by American troops in Operation Torch (see\nWorld War II in Africa\n) and hosted the 1943 Casablanca conference.\nMorocco's long struggle for independence from France ended in 1956. The internationalized city of Tangier was turned over to the new country that same year. Morocco annexed\nWestern Sahara\nduring the late 1970s, and even though the status of the territory remains unresolved, all maps in Morocco show Western Sahara as an integrated part of Morocco.\nGradual political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature in 1997, although the king still possesses the actual political power. The press is mostly state controlled even though there are free newspapers, and clampdowns have occurred following criticism of the authorities or articles concerning the Western Sahara situation."

    "text": "Understand\n[\nedit\n]\nTenerife, the largest island of the\nCanary Islands\narchipelago and home to ca. 900,000 inhabitants, is a fantastic holiday destination. The island has a rich cultural history dating back thousands of years when it was populated by the Guanche aborigines, and colonial architecture dating from the 1497 Spanish conquest of the island can be admired in many of its modern towns and cities. Historic capital city\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\nis an architectural gem on its own, and its centre is one of the island's two\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites\n.\nIn addition to its cultural assets, Tenerife also has many natural treasures. The most famous of which is\nTeide National Park\n, the island's other UNESCO World Heritage site, and home to Spain's tallest mountain\nEl Teide\n(3,715 m above sea level), also the world's 3rd highest volcano (after the\nHawaiian\nvolcanoes). It is the oldest and largest protected area of the Canary Islands, and receives ca. 3 million visitors annually. The north of the island is also a natural reserve, the\nAnaga Rural Park\n.\nA poor, banana-growing region in past decades, Tenerife has been brought up to European living standards since the arrival of mass air travel in the 1960s, which brought industry and millions of tourists each year. Over the decades this has led to many complexes and houses being built, making parts of the island highly urbanized. While part of the EU for political purposes, the island remains outside its customs and VAT area, making high tax goods such as tobacco and alcohol cheaper than elsewhere in\nEurope\n. Because almost all goods must be imported, food and clothing in particular are more expensive than on mainland Europe.\nMany of the younger tourists hang out on the south of the island where there are plenty of hotels, activities and British food and drink. Older tourists and families tend to choose Puerto de La Cruz and its environs on the northern side, where you will find more green and vibrant local culture with a more Spanish year-round springtime feel.\nClimate\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nCanary Islands#Climate\nTenerife\nClimate chart (\nexplanation\n)\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\n86\n19\n14\n75\n20\n13\n64\n21\n14\n43\n22\n14\n22\n23\n15\n12\n25\n17\n7\n28\n19\n7\n29\n20\n17\n28\n20\n53\n26\n19\n90\n23\n17\n88\n20\n15\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °C\nPrecipitation\n+\nSnow\ntotals in mm\nImperial conversion\nJ\nF\nM\nA\nM\nJ\nJ\nA\nS\nO\nN\nD\n3.4\n66\n57\n3\n68\n55\n2.5\n70\n57\n1.7\n72\n57\n0.9\n73\n59\n0.5\n77\n63\n0.3\n82\n66\n0.3\n84\n68\n0.7\n82\n68\n2.1\n79\n66\n3.5\n73\n63\n3.5\n68\n59\nAverage max. and min. temperatures in °F\nPrecipitation\n+\nSnow\ntotals in inches\nThe Atlantic ocean absorbs heat in summer and releases it in winter, granting Tenerife fairly constant temperatures throughout the year, with typically less than 10° difference between summer and winter. In combination with its proximity to the equator, this results in mild temperatures from fall to spring, and hot temperatures in summer (June to September). Fortunately the ocean winds cool the island down, and at higher elevations the temperatures are very mild even when the low laying parts of the island succumb under a scorching heat.\nTenerife receives most of its precipitation during the winter months (\nNovember\nto\nFebruary\n), which always falls as rain at sea level and as snow on\nEl Teide\n.\nOn the south side there is consistent summer, little to no wind, and pretty much perfect beach-weather for much of the year though there have been rare instances of cool to cold weather in the Jan-Feb period. Also expect some very wet days for that time of year though most days will still be sunny. In the North, the weather fluctuates a bit more, but is also mostly pleasant though not as hot as the south."

Do not even attempt to block their way and let them pass, as many of them can be quite aggressive. Although stations are full of surveillance cameras, they are seldom used to either enforce fare payment or as a proof for filed assault charges, except in the most severe cases. Lack of staff in many stations and few ticket inspections effectively mean\ncarte blanche\nfor them. The fare evasion fine is just €50 if paid on spot, no matter how many times the culprit has previously been caught, and many fines remain unpaid because payment enforcement is legally cumbersome."

Islam is by far the dominant religion, with 99% of the population being at least nominally Muslim. Christianity is the second largest religion, but most Christians in Morocco are expatriates from Western countries. Morocco used to have a large Jewish community, most of whom were Sephardic Jews whose ancestors fled the Spanish and Portuguese inquisitions, though the vast majority of them fled to Israel in the second half of the 20th century, and only a small community remains in Morocco today.

In combination with its proximity to the equator, this results in mild temperatures from fall to spring, and hot temperatures in summer (June to September). Fortunately the ocean winds cool the island down, and at higher elevations the temperatures are very mild even when the low laying parts of the island succumb under a scorching heat.\nTenerife receives most of its precipitation during the winter months (\nNovember\nto\nFebruary\n), which always falls as rain at sea level and as snow on\nEl Teide\n.\nOn the south side there is consistent summer, little to no wind, and pretty much perfect beach-weather for much of the year though there have been rare instances of cool to cold weather in the Jan-Feb period.

You will need a police report to claim the value of the items stolen for your travel insurance.\nBeware of women, particularly around the cathedral (though you may find them in other tourist spots), who \"offer\" you sprigs of rosemary. They'll hold one out to you, but take it and they'll demand payment. If that's not bad enough, they consider coins bad luck so they won't accept anything less than €5. Though not really a threat, their persistence can be quite alarming. Avoid eye contact, firmly but politely say \"\nNo, gracias\n\" and don't let them shove anything into your hands."

In this local dialect a soft 'c' is pronounced as 's' rather than as 'th' on the Spanish mainland, so cinco (five) is 'sinko', not 'thinko'.\nDespite the prevalence of tourists on the island, English and other European languages are not understood by many locals, even in larger cities such as\nLa Orotava\nand\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\n, but rather only spoken around tourist attractions such as\nEl Teide\n. Staff in hotels and restaurants generally know enough basic English to take your order or help with problems. Many restaurants have a multilingual menu (Spanish/English/German). In smaller towns such as\nSantiago del Teide\nor\nVilaflor\n, understanding of English is very limited and you'll need to rely on your own translation skills.\nSanta Cruz de Tenerife\nis the capital city and, despite its importance as a seaport, has a very local demographic; languages other than Spanish are therefore rarely heard in the streets."

The two others attractions cost €9.5, last approximately 1 hour and have a Spanish-speaking guide. The tubo volcánico is a volcanic tube (a single page with few English explanations will be given). The Lagartario is a home to giant lizards, looking like small dragons, that earlier were on the verge of extinction (posters are translated in English)."

At the end of the month is the holiday of\nEid al-Fitr\n, when practically everything closes for as long as a week and transport is packed as everybody heads back home. Alcohol consumption is not prohibited for tourists during Ramadan; there are a few restaurants and bars serving alcohol.

Because of the reserve, a lot of species live there, and other ones go there to find food (whales, sharks, dolphins, turtles, etc.) You can buy your material or rent it. Each centre has its own boat to take scuba divers out to open water. The instructors, good experts of the underwater spots, will bring you to the most interesting places, passing through lava arches, visiting ballon-fish lairs, and a lot of other fascinating sensations.\nExtra Divers\n,\nAvenida Maritima 2\n(\nLa Restinga\n),\n☏\n+34 628 849 350\n,\nelhierro@extradivers.org\n.\nBoat trips for swimming and snorkelling on the calm Atlantic Ocean in Mar de las Calmas between La Restinga and the Faro de Orchilla lighthouse.

Many Moroccans are multilingual. As for European languages, younger people and people working in touristic areas are more likely to speak English, while older people and those in smaller towns might be more likely to speak some French. Mileage may vary though, of course, and knowing basics in both does help. If you are unsure, just ask which language someone prefers.\nMoroccan Arabic\n(also known as\nDarija\n), the local vernacular, is spoken natively by about 91% of the population. The dialect is one of the toughest Arabic dialects to learn; native speakers of Arabic outside of Morocco often have trouble understanding the way Moroccans speak. Some consider the dialect a different language altogether. If you don't know the local dialect, do not despair: all Moroccans learn\nModern Standard Arabic\nat school, so you should have no problems communicating in large cities.\nTashelhit\nand\nCentral Morocco Tamazight\nare the most commonly spoken Berber languages.

The language is held in high regard; French is taught in Moroccan schools from a young age and the language is used in many avenues such as business, government, and commerce. French is often used to transliterate Arabic words. For example, the name Abdullah is transliterated as Abdellah.\nSpanish\nis spoken by some Moroccans living in\nMediterranean Morocco\n. Moroccans born during and before the 1950s ― parts of Morocco were under the administration of\nSpain\nback then ― are more likely to be competent in Spanish than their juniors.\nEnglish\nis increasingly becoming popular in Morocco and the Moroccan government is keen on promoting the language. This being said, English is not widely spoken in Morocco and not everyone is happy with the government's decision to espouse English. Tourist destinations that have become popular with Northern European visitors, like\nTaghazout\nor\nMarrakech\n, are where you will likely find the most English-speaking Moroccans."

They charge the equivalent of UK £17 for a single entry and £26 for double or multiple entries. (Double or Multiple entries will be issued at the embassy's discretion). Visas are usually valid for three months and take around 5-6 working days to process.\nVisa requirements are completed application forms; four passport-size photos taken within the previous six months; a valid passport with at least one blank page and with a photocopy of the relevant data pages; Fee, payable by postal order only; a photocopy of all flight bookings and a photocopy of hotel reservation.\nTourists can stay for up to 90 days, and visa extensions can be frustrating and time-consuming.

In addition to destinations across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, one can also fly intercontinental from\nNew York\n,\nWashington, D.C.\n,\nMiami\n,\nMontreal\n,\nRio de Janeiro\nand\nSao Paulo\n.\nOther popular entry points include\nMarrakesh\n,\nAgadir\n,\nFes\n,\nRabat\n, and\nTangier\n, to which many European low-cost carriers fly either year-round or seasonally.\nEasyjet\n— Now fly at budget prices from\nLondon\nand\nManchester\nto\nMarrakech\nand\nCasablanca\n. Another option is from\nParis - Charles de Gaulle\nto\nCasablanca\n.\nRyanair\n— flies to Morocco from\nBergamo\n,\nGirona\n,\nReus\n,\nMadrid\n,\nBrussels\n, \"Frankfurt\"-\nHahn\n, Eindhoven,\nLondon\n,\nPorto\n. Flying to\nFez\n3 times per week. Flights to Marrakesh are also available.\nRoyal Air Maroc\n— The state airline, which drastically needs a price cut.\nAir Arabia Maroc\nowned by Air Arabia, is another low-cost carrier which flies to other Moroccan destinations, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Tunisia and Turkey.\nBinter Canarias\n— Flights from Canary Islands to Marrakesh.\nEmirates\n— Flights from Dubai to Casablanca.\nMany visitors also fly to\nGibraltar\nor\nMalaga\n(which are often considerably cheaper to get to) and take a ferry from\nAlgeciras\n,\nTarifa\nor Gibraltar to\nTangier\n. This is not recommended in summer as literally millions of Moroccans living in\nEurope\nuse this passage during the summer holidays.\nBy car\n[\nedit\n]\nYou can enter via ferry or via the two only open border posts on land connected to the Spanish enclaves of\nCeuta\nand\nMelilla\n. The frontier with Algeria has been closed since 1994. For the closest maritime connection you head for\nAlgeciras\nor\nTarifa\nin southern\nSpain\n. At Algeciras there are ferry services to Ceuta and\nTangier\nthat carry cars. Tarifa has a similar service to Tangier and this is the shortest and fastest route, just 35 minutes.\nIt's possible also to enter by car from\nMauritania\nvia\nDakhla\n.\nIt might be hard to get into Morocco with a commercial vehicle. Camper vans are acceptable (but they must look like a camper van), but other commercial vehicles might get turned around and prevented from travelling onwards. If you want to take a commercial vehicle, and there is more than one person travelling, it may be worthwhile if a French-speaking person travels to any international border with Morocco of your choice and meets with the head of Customs before you bring in a commercial vehicle.\nBy boat\n[\nedit\n]\nBoarding a Tarifa - Tangier ferry\nThere are several ferry connections to Morocco, mainly from\nSpain\n. The most popular one is from\nAlgeciras\nto\nTangier\n, €37, approx 1 hr trip, another one is from the small port of\nTarifa\n, on the southernmost tip of mainland Spain. A free shuttle bus between Tarifa and Algeciras (25 min) is provided for all ferry passengers, so you will have no problems getting to the Algeciras train station. Other Spanish ports with connections to Morocco are\nMalaga\nand\nAlmeria\nwith departures to\nMelilla\nand the adjacent Moroccan town of\nNador\n.\nFerries from\nMarseille\nand the port of\nSète\nnear\nMontpellier\nin\nFrance\nalso go to Tangier. However, they are rather expensive.\nThe Italian towns of\nGenoa\nand\nNaples\nalso have direct connections to Tangier.\nThe British dependency of\nGibraltar\nhas irregular ferries to Tangier (no more than 2 departures per month).\nEnsure your ticket takes you to the right port, as for instance\n35.876528\n-5.516655\n1\nTanger Med port\nis 50 km from Tangier city.\nFrom the south of Spain (Estepona) a sailing yacht will take you for a few days to the north east of Morocco (Smir)."

    "text": "Get around\n[\nedit\n]\nBy rental car\n[\nedit\n]\nIf you are in the possession of a driver's licence, a rental car is the best option for discovering the remote locations on the island—see\nCanary Islands#By rental car\nfor more information.\nDriving\n[\nedit\n]\nMost of the road network is in good shape, although roads in the mountains may be less well maintained. Fallen rocks blocking the road are a recurring hazard, especially on roads carved into the mountain side. The highways around the island are toll-free and mostly limited to 120 km/h. Everything called \"Calle\" or \"Camino\" in the rural and residential areas is likely to be very narrow and potentially steep and curvy.\nEspecially during the weekend, many people come out with their bicycles and motorbikes and use the island's roads for extensive leisure trips. Be particularly cautious and mindful then—everyone wants to enjoy their time.\nNavigation\n[\nedit\n]\nThe road network is under active (re)construction. As of 2019, your rental car's built-in navigation system may still be missing some of the newer main roads. Google Maps appears to be fairly complete in terms of major roads.\nOpenStreetMap\nprovides very complete maps of the islands roads, hiking trails and other points of interest.\nWhen planning excursions and trips, keep travel times in mind. Satellite navigation systems usually assume you'll be travelling at the speed limit, which is unrealistic on most of the road network. An actual average speed of 30 km/h or below is realistic for tourists, although locals who know the road network well can be seen racing up and down mountains occasionally.\nBy public transport\n[\nedit\n]\nA\nten+\n[dead link]\n(\nten mas\n) travel card (€2 deposit) is a good idea if you intend to spend some time travelling on the buses and trams in Tenerife. It can be charged with any amount of €2–100, and provides decent discounts over cash payments. It can be bought and recharged at\nmore than 500 locations\n[dead link]\nacross the island—besides the bus stations of course.\nIn addition, the\nten+\ncard can be charged with a travel package (using the money on the card), which allows for unlimited travel for a number of hours or days: 24 hr for €10, and 7 days for €50–see\nwebsite\n[dead link]\n. However, unless you are planning to use buses more than 4-5 times a day and for longer distances, these packages often don't really make sense, considering the steep discounts the card already provides. The day package however pays off for specific cases, e.g. a day trip to Teide and back, or for taking the express bus from the airport to Puerto de la Cruz.\nIn buses the card has to be tapped twice onto the (RFID) reader, once when entering and once when leaving. In the tram it only has to be tapped once, when entering. One card can be used for several people, they just have to be tapped the number of people that travel on the card when entering any vehicle, but only once when exiting. If this sounds too complicated, one can always just tell the bus driver \"Dos para Costa Adeje\" (\"Two people to Costa Adeje\"), and he will prepare a ticket that you pay by tapping the card onto the reader. (For active travel packages on the card, tapping once in the bus is enough though.)\nThere is also a rechargeable paper card available at tram stations (no deposit), which is also valid on buses around the island, but it can only be recharged at major bus stations.\nFurthermore, instead of the card there is the\nten+móvil\nsmartphone app for\nAndroid\nor\niOS\n, but its handling seems to be more difficult.\nPaying with cash in buses can sometimes be a problem. In the tram cash payment is not available.\nBy bus\n[\nedit\n]\nTenerife's network of green TITSA buses will get you almost anywhere on the island.\nLike everywhere in the\nCanary Islands\n, Tenerife's buses are called\nguaguas\n, the Canarian Spanish word for bus. Consequently, a bus station is called\nEstación de Guaguas\n.\nThe local bus company\nTITSA\n[dead link]\noperates a very efficient and comprehensive network. Unless you want to explore mostly remote places, you can rely on it. Though, during the weekend the bus frequencies are generally reduced.\nFind\nroute planner\n[dead link]\n,\nspecific bus times\n[dead link]\nand\nfares\n[dead link]\non their\nwebsite\n[dead link]\n.\nOtherwise, each bus stop usually comes with a QR code, which you can use to inquire the next upcoming connections/buses. In addition to the Titsa website, the\nÖffi app\nand the Moovit app (\nPlay Store\n,\niOS\n) are good for route planning, even though the latter one will bombard you with a lot of ads. All (including the Titsa website and the QR code at bus stops) are good for an estimation of the route and schedule, but they are not always great in estimating bus delays.\nDon't rely on Google Maps, they seem to have an issue with timezone conversion and bus times are often out of schedule by one hour.\nBy tram\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are two\ntram lines\n[dead link]\nin the metropolitan area of\nSanta Cruz\nand\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\n.\nThere is an automated ticket vending machine at every stop; a one-way fare costs\n€1.35\n, and\nten+\ncards are accepted.\nBy bicycle\n[\nedit\n]\nThe TF-28 in the rocky desert of south Tenerife.\nCycling can also be a flexible and environmentally friendly way to get around the island. Tenerife is less than 100 km long, and fairly easy to explore with a city bike or mountain bike. Most of the major roads are well maintained and not too steep, although you'll need to take your time to get up El Teide if you wish to climb the volcano on a bicycle! The TF-28 for example leads from the capital\nSanta Cruz\nto\nCandelaria\n,\nGüímar\n, and all the way down to\nGranadilla de Abona\non a nearly perfectly asphalted road surface.\nBy thumb\n[\nedit\n]\nWith many tourists around in their rental car, it can be quite easy to catch a ride in remote places. Hence, it is often no issue to get out of the Teide valley or other nature parks. Also locals are happy to take people for the short ride.\nInside of towns or cities you will be less lucky, but if you walk somewhere where there is obviously just one direction to go, you won't have many problems finding a ride.\nBy taxi\n[\nedit\n]\nBe cautious with the taxi drivers on Tenerife. There have been incidences where they will try to widely overcharge tourists or will demand money beyond what the meter is showing. Some even fiddling with the meter to add extra charges after arrival, even though there was no such reason (airport, night, etc.).\nOn foot\n[\nedit\n]\nTenerife has many interesting sights and trails within its variety of nature environments. For reliable maps and comprehensive trails, a good deal of sights and tourist attractions,\nGPS navigation\nand general map information, consult\nOpenStreetMap\n, which is also used by this travel guide, and by many mobile Apps like\nOsmAnd\nor\nMapy.cz\n. Or just download the according GPX or KML files (for your app) through\nWaymarked Trails\nfor such trails on OpenStreetMap."

However, places like Malaga, Marbella, Fuengirola, and Seville attract millions of tourists yearly, and as with most heavily touristy places, some foreigners will end up partying like animals, despite the police's efforts to keep the peace.\nIn Granada and Cordoba, it is advisable to avoid women offering plants (usually heather). They will offer you a plant for free, and then when you accept it, they will read your palm and demand money. If you refuse to give it to them, they may start screaming at you, and you will generally want to avoid this situation. Aside from this, the area is usually very safe, but one should still take the usual precautions, especially in Malaga, Seville, etc.\nDespite the strong agricultural and tourism sectors, Andalusia has some of the poorest towns in Spain; cities like Jerez, Cadiz, Huelva, and Almeria all have unemployment rates well above 20%. As such, opportunistic crimes like pickpockets do occur.\nWhile parts of the Andalusian coast have made headlines for scenes of migrant boats landing on beaches, they are not as frequent as the media might suggest, and most of the time, migrants tend to stick to themselves if left alone."

    "text": "By rental car\n[\nedit\n]\nIf you are in the possession of a driver's licence, a rental car is the best option for discovering the remote locations on the island—see\nCanary Islands#By rental car\nfor more information.\nDriving\n[\nedit\n]\nMost of the road network is in good shape, although roads in the mountains may be less well maintained. Fallen rocks blocking the road are a recurring hazard, especially on roads carved into the mountain side. The highways around the island are toll-free and mostly limited to 120 km/h. Everything called \"Calle\" or \"Camino\" in the rural and residential areas is likely to be very narrow and potentially steep and curvy.\nEspecially during the weekend, many people come out with their bicycles and motorbikes and use the island's roads for extensive leisure trips. Be particularly cautious and mindful then—everyone wants to enjoy their time.\nNavigation\n[\nedit\n]\nThe road network is under active (re)construction. As of 2019, your rental car's built-in navigation system may still be missing some of the newer main roads. Google Maps appears to be fairly complete in terms of major roads.\nOpenStreetMap\nprovides very complete maps of the islands roads, hiking trails and other points of interest.\nWhen planning excursions and trips, keep travel times in mind. Satellite navigation systems usually assume you'll be travelling at the speed limit, which is unrealistic on most of the road network. An actual average speed of 30 km/h or below is realistic for tourists, although locals who know the road network well can be seen racing up and down mountains occasionally."

Fallen rocks blocking the road are a recurring hazard, especially on roads carved into the mountain side. The highways around the island are toll-free and mostly limited to 120 km/h. Everything called \"Calle\" or \"Camino\" in the rural and residential areas is likely to be very narrow and potentially steep and curvy.\nEspecially during the weekend, many people come out with their bicycles and motorbikes and use the island's roads for extensive leisure trips. Be particularly cautious and mindful then—everyone wants to enjoy their time."

It can be charged with any amount of €2–100, and provides decent discounts over cash payments. It can be bought and recharged at\nmore than 500 locations\n[dead link]\nacross the island—besides the bus stations of course.\nIn addition, the\nten+\ncard can be charged with a travel package (using the money on the card), which allows for unlimited travel for a number of hours or days: 24 hr for €10, and 7 days for €50–see\nwebsite\n[dead link]\n. However, unless you are planning to use buses more than 4-5 times a day and for longer distances, these packages often don't really make sense, considering the steep discounts the card already provides. The day package however pays off for specific cases, e.g. a day trip to Teide and back, or for taking the express bus from the airport to Puerto de la Cruz.\nIn buses the card has to be tapped twice onto the (RFID) reader, once when entering and once when leaving. In the tram it only has to be tapped once, when entering. One card can be used for several people, they just have to be tapped the number of people that travel on the card when entering any vehicle, but only once when exiting. If this sounds too complicated, one can always just tell the bus driver \"Dos para Costa Adeje\" (\"Two people to Costa Adeje\"), and he will prepare a ticket that you pay by tapping the card onto the reader. (For active travel packages on the card, tapping once in the bus is enough though.)\nThere is also a rechargeable paper card available at tram stations (no deposit), which is also valid on buses around the island, but it can only be recharged at major bus stations.\nFurthermore, instead of the card there is the\nten+móvil\nsmartphone app for\nAndroid\nor\niOS\n, but its handling seems to be more difficult.\nPaying with cash in buses can sometimes be a problem. In the tram cash payment is not available.\nBy bus\n[\nedit\n]\nTenerife's network of green TITSA buses will get you almost anywhere on the island.\nLike everywhere in the\nCanary Islands\n, Tenerife's buses are called\nguaguas\n, the Canarian Spanish word for bus.

All (including the Titsa website and the QR code at bus stops) are good for an estimation of the route and schedule, but they are not always great in estimating bus delays.\nDon't rely on Google Maps, they seem to have an issue with timezone conversion and bus times are often out of schedule by one hour.\nBy tram\n[\nedit\n]\nThere are two\ntram lines\n[dead link]\nin the metropolitan area of\nSanta Cruz\nand\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\n.\nThere is an automated ticket vending machine at every stop; a one-way fare costs\n€1.35\n, and\nten+\ncards are accepted."

Maps may list street names in Valencian or Spanish and rarely both, while addresses may be given in either language, which could create some confusion. Addresses in this guide are generally listed in Valencian.\nThe city has begun changing some Franco-era street names to those commemorating other figures, especially women. By late 2017, about 50 streets had been renamed, with more planned; online mapping services are largely up-to-date but printed maps will likely not be.\nOn foot\n[\nedit\n]\nAside from going to the beach and the City of Arts and Sciences, exploring the hub of the city requires no public transportation. Much of this city can be done walking, stopping for a coffee or a beer, and then walking more, all very leisurely. It's not necessary to have the mindset of mastering a complex public transportation system. However, for longer trips, see below for some pointers.\nBy public transportation\n[\nedit\n]\nTravellers visiting for a short period may want to consider purchasing a\nValencia Tourist Card\n, a one-, two- or three-day pass which allows for unlimited travel on all metro and bus lines, including to/from the airport, over a period of 24 hours (€15), 48 hours (€20), or 72 hours (€25). The card also includes free admission to public museums and monuments, discounted admission for other tourist attractions, and additional discounts at some shops and restaurants. The card can be purchased at any tourist office, including at the airport, or purchased online for a discount and picked up on arrival at a tourist office.\nFor travellers not interested in the package, or staying longer than three days, the rechargeable\nSUMA 10\ncard provides a flexible means of getting around. It is valid for both metro and bus travel. This card allows for ten journeys, including transfers begun within 90 minutes of commencing your journey. The included transfers comprise unlimited transfers between metro (or tram) lines, and a single transfer to or from bus lines (i.e. between buses or to/from the metro). Cards are not personalized, and a single card can be used by multiple people (deducting multiple journeys, of course).\nThe SUMA 10 cards are sold in ticket offices in metro stations, and as of 2025 cost €8 (€4 until 30th June 25) for a single zone. There is an additional fee of €1 for a cardboard cart and €2 for a plastic card. The cards can be recharged at any metro ticket machine. Since 2022, this ticket replaces the previous\nBono transbordo\nand\nBonometro\ncards, so guides still referencing these are outdated.\nThe public transport network is divided into zones A, B, and + (see\nmap\n, ). There is a significant overlap between zones A and B. Most tourist destinations, including the beach, are located in zone A. Zone + consists solely of the airport.\nThe EMT (bus) website has a very helpful\nroute-planner\n[dead link]\n, useful for planning journeys not only by bus but also by metro, bicycle, and Valenbisi (see the bicycle section below).\nBy metro\n[\nedit\n]\nMetro Valencia\nThe\nMetro Valencia\nconsists of nine lines (three of which are tramlines) and connects the suburbs with the city. This metro system is not extensive, but can get you to major points within the city. Maps and timetables can be downloaded\nhere\n. In 2025, the one-way fare for a single zone is €1.50. The ticket costs an additional €1 and contains a rechargeable chip.\nMake sure to always keep your ticket, as you must present it when getting off as well. If you want to enter the tram, you must buy a ticket from the machine (at each tram stop), and then validate it\nbefore\nyou get on.\nIf you use the metro a lot, you should consider getting a 10-fare\nSUMA 10\ncard (see above).\nNOTE\nParts of the metro were closed following the October 2024 floods, for a current map click\nhere\n.\nStandard bicycles are permitted during the workweek only on portions of the network which operate above ground. On Saturday, Sunday and holidays they are permitted throughout, while folding bicycles may be transported at any time. No bicycles are permitted at all during Fallas and the night of San Juan. Pets in carriers and guide or personal assistance dogs are also permitted.\nBy train\n[\nedit\n]\nValencia has a Cercanías suburban rail network with\nfive lines\nradiating out from the\nEstació del Nord\nto well beyond the city. Note these trains are timetabled & ticketed separately to main line trains lookout for the\nsymbol. \nYou can pay for these trains with a contactless bank card at the ticket barriers.\nBy bus\n[\nedit\n]\nPublic EMT bus and Valencia Bus Turistic\nEMT\n[dead link]\nruns buses to virtually every part of the city, both day and night. A single ticket costs €2 (no transfers, 2025), payable to the bus driver on entry and can be paid in cash or with a bank card. (note: the EMT website is geo-blocked and only works when connected to a Spanish network)\nFor frequent travellers, a the rechargeable\nBonobús\ncard is available in kiosks and tobacco shops. It will allow you ten rides for €8.50 (as of early 2018). However, the\nSUMA 10\n, which is also valid and metro and tram lines, usually is the cheaper and more convenient option (see above). Bonobús cards can be recharged at\nkiosks\n[dead link]\nor online.\nFor travellers with smartphones, there is a very helpful official EMT app (iPhone and Android), which has a route planner and a QRT reader.\nMost bus stops now have digital displays listing the arrival times for the next bus. At those stops lacking the digital display it is still easy to find out the next arrival times, by using either a QRT reader (like the one built into the EMT app), or by sending a SMS with the unique number of the bus stop to a number displayed next to the posted route plan.\nBy tourist bus\n[\nedit\n]\n39.47453\n-0.3759\n1\nValencia Bus Turistic\n,\nPlaça de la Reina, 10\n,\n☏\n+34 699 982 514\n,\nvalenciabusturistic@valenciabusturistic.com\n.\nDaily 09:30-20:00 (office)\n.\nIn cooperation with the city's official tourism office Valencia Bus Turistic operates a hop-on, hop-off bus service which covers two routes: the\nHistoric Route\n, which covers most of the centre of the city (schedule available\nhere\n), and the\nMaritime Route\n, which visits the Royal Marina, the City of Arts and Sciences, and the beaches (schedule available\nhere\n). Each route includes a guided commentary in multiple languages, and the two routes intersect at three locations; it is permitted to combine both routes, if desired. Tickets can be purchased at any bus stop, tourist information centre, and in many hotels.\n24/48 hour tickets: €17/19 (adults), €10/11 (children 7-16), free (children under 7); 12% discount with the\nValencia Tourist Card\n(available at tourist information centres)\n.\n(\nupdated Jun 2017\n)\nBy bicycle\n[\nedit\n]\nValenbisi station\nValencia is essentially flat, and cycling has become a popular way for visitors to get around. The city has established a comprehensive network of dedicated bicycle paths and lanes, and the Turia river park very conveniently cuts across the city, making it possible to get from one end to the other with minimal time in traffic. Drivers are now accustomed to interacting with cyclists in traffic, although pedestrians still occasionally wander into bike paths. Riding on sidewalks without demarcated bicycle paths is not permitted, but this is generally not enforced. At night lights are required, and a helmet and reflective vest are recommended. A bicycle route map can be downloaded\nhere\n[dead link]\n.\nThe city operates\nValenbisi\n, a popular bicycle sharing program, with 275 stations distributed throughout the city. No reservation is necessary – once you have a Valenbisi card, go to the interactive station terminal, follow the instructions in Valencian, Spanish or English, and choose a bicycle. You can return the bicycle to the same or any other station with available docks.\nA short-term subscription costs €13.04 and gives you access to unlimited use of the bikes for 7 days; the first half-hour of any journey is free, then €1.04 is charged for the first two additional half-hours, with €3.12 charged for every additional hour. However, if you park the bicycle in an available dock before the first half-hour is up, you can take out a new bicycle and reset the clock for no additional fees.\nWeekly cards can be purchased at any station terminal with a credit card. For periods longer than one week, an annual subscription is necessary and costs €27.12, with reduced tariffs for each additional half-hour. These cards must be purchased online and are sent by mail; however it is possible to bypass this hassle and attach your Valenbisi subscription to a valid\nBonometro\n,\nBonobús\n, or\nBono transbordo\ncard – see the website for details.\nThere are also many bicycle rental shops in town, with most charging around €10-15 a day, depending on season.\n39.47382\n-0.37401\n2\nDoYouBike\n,\nCarrer del Mar, 14\n(\nnear the cathedral\n),\n☏\n+34 963 155 551\n,\ninfo@doyoubike.com\n.\nDaily 09:45-14:00, 17:00-20:15\n.\nRents bikes.

    "text": "By bus\n[\nedit\n]\nTenerife's network of green TITSA buses will get you almost anywhere on the island.\nLike everywhere in the\nCanary Islands\n, Tenerife's buses are called\nguaguas\n, the Canarian Spanish word for bus. Consequently, a bus station is called\nEstación de Guaguas\n.\nThe local bus company\nTITSA\n[dead link]\noperates a very efficient and comprehensive network. Unless you want to explore mostly remote places, you can rely on it. Though, during the weekend the bus frequencies are generally reduced.\nFind\nroute planner\n[dead link]\n,\nspecific bus times\n[dead link]\nand\nfares\n[dead link]\non their\nwebsite\n[dead link]\n.\nOtherwise, each bus stop usually comes with a QR code, which you can use to inquire the next upcoming connections/buses. In addition to the Titsa website, the\nÖffi app\nand the Moovit app (\nPlay Store\n,\niOS\n) are good for route planning, even though the latter one will bombard you with a lot of ads. All (including the Titsa website and the QR code at bus stops) are good for an estimation of the route and schedule, but they are not always great in estimating bus delays.\nDon't rely on Google Maps, they seem to have an issue with timezone conversion and bus times are often out of schedule by one hour."

    "text": "Get around\n[\nedit\n]\nWith an area of 446,300 square kilometres (172,300 sq mi), Morocco is a relatively easy country to get around in. A trip from\nTaroudant\nto\nRabat\nwill easily take you 5½ hours by car, depending on traffic conditions.\nBy train\n[\nedit\n]\nMoroccan intercity train\nTrains are generally the best option because of their speed, frequency and comfort. However, the network is limited, though traveling to many of the tourist destination. Two of the main lines, which both operate hourly most of the day are the following:\nAl Boraq\nhigh speed rail\ntrain, traveling between\nTangier\nand\nCasablanca\nvia\nRabat\nand Kenitra.  Between Tangier and Casablanca, trains take about 2 hours 20 minutes to complete the journey.  Until further construction takes place, only the portion between Tangier and Kenitra is along high speed rail, where it travels at 300 km/h, and otherwise the trains travel around 160 km/h.\nLine between\nMarrakech\n, Casablanca, Rabat, Kenitra,\nMeknes\n, and\nFez\n.  While this is not a high speed train, much of journey is at 160 km/h.\nA branch line to Oujda starts at\nSidi Kachem\nlinking\nMeknes\nand\nFez\nto the main lines.\nThe rail network is operated by\nONCF\n[dead link]\n. Tickets can be purchased both online and at stations and they are very cheap compared to Europe. For examples, Casablanca to Marrakech: 146 dirham for second class, 180 first, 2 hours 39 minutes. The only drawback with Moroccan trains are that they are very frequently delayed, so don't count on the timetables if you are in a hurry.\nPeople are incredibly sociable and friendly on the trains in Morocco and you will find yourself perpetually talking to strangers about your journey. Each new person will advise you on some new place you should go or invite you to their home for couscous. Stations in smaller cities are often poorly marked, and your fellow passengers will be more than happy to let you know where you are and when you should get off. It's expected to greet (\nSalam\n) new passengers entering your compartment, and if you bring fruit, cake, etc., it's common to offer the other passengers something as well. If you spend a little extra for 1st class you increase your chances of meeting someone proficient in many languages.\nThere are three daily departures from Tangier, bound for either\nOujda\nor Marrakech, although all of them can be used to reach either destination as there are corresponding trains in Sidi Kachem using the opposite branch of the train coming from Tangier. The night trains between Tangier and Marrakech offer couchettes for an extra 100 dirham. This is the only option if you would like to lie down sleeping as there are obstacles between the seats in regular compartments.\nIn summer, train compartments can be hot, with passengers standing everywhere when all seats are taken. First class train cars are supposed to have working air conditioning, however, not all train cars with air conditioning have it in working mode, so it's advisable to bring with you plenty of water (there are no vending machines on\nONCF\n[dead link]\ntrains, unlike SNCF or TrenItalia trains, and the conductor with a vending cart is not often easy to find). For example, the travel time between Tangier and Fez is about 5 hours and with no AC and no water, the ride can become unbearable in the summer desert heat.\nWhen you arrive at a station, to reaching the platform you'll need to validate your ticket (checkpoint at the entrance).\nBy bus\n[\nedit\n]\nLuxury\nbuses\nare the next best bet, with almost universal coverage, if somewhat odd departure times in some places.\nCTM\n,\nSupratours\nand some smaller companies provide good comfort with reasonable prices. Supratours buses offer specific tickets to link with the rail system and are bookable on the train company website as Supratours is run by it. All bus companies charge for baggage separately, however CTM is the only one that does this officially and provides baggage receipts. On Supratours, whoever takes your bag will demand up to 20 dirham (pay no more than 5 dirham). Do not pay for luggage that you can take aboard with you and that fits in the overhead locker of between your feet. Touts will try to charge you for that, strongly refuse.\nNearly every city has a central bus station (\nGare Routière\n) where you can buy tickets to travel from region to region (and in some cities certain companies run their own stations - mostly that applies to the operators CTM (\nGare Voyage\n) and partly Supratours). You can either choose the buses for tourists with air-conditioning and a TV. Or you can also take the local buses which cost only 25-50% of the tourist buses and are much more fun. They are not very comfortable, but you can get in contact with the local people and learn a lot about the country. The buses often take longer routes than the big ones, so you can see villages you would never get to as a \"normal\" tourist. For heat-sensitive people this is not advisable though, as locals may tell you that 35 degrees is \"cool\" and no reason for opening a window. The route from Rissani, Erfoud, and Er Rachidia to Meknes and Fez, while long, runs through the Middle and High Atlas and is particularly scenic.\nAt the large bus stations (\nGare Routière\n), always buy your ticket at the ticket window inside of the bus station. Otherwise you will mostly overpay. Several touts will approach you as you enter the bus station, and try to sell you a ticket. While a local will get a proper ticket with them (because they know the prices), tourists will most certainly be overcharged. Also, the ticket windows often (must) have prices and time tables displayed. You might get the ticket with the same guy that approached you in the beginning, but it will consequently be much cheaper.\nLocal intercity buses can be entered along the highway or main road, where you will pay the conductor. Always ask for the price before entering, and if too high, refuse. At least the conductors will understand, that you will not board if too high and give you a good price. Supratours and CTM buses will not stop anywhere for you to enter except for the main bus stations—the driver is not allowed to sell tickets.\nLuxury buses operated by\nCTM\nare also inexpensive and offer an easier travelling experience than local buses.\nSupratours\n, a major rival of CTM, complements the train network to Essaouira and all major Atlantic-coast towns south to Marrakech.\nCTM and Supratours tickets can often not be booked online directly with the bus operator using a foreign bank card. In this case, they can either be bought in person at the bus stations, or using\nMarrakech Tickets\n. Note that Marrakech Tickets will charge a significant fee and take a few hours (or even days) to process your request, which involves sending you an invoice by email.\nLocal intercity buses\nare a completely valid choice for the hardier traveller, and often even have more leg room than the luxury buses although this may be just because the seat in front of you is disintegrating. They can be extraordinarily slow as they will stop for anyone, anywhere, and only luxury buses are air conditioned (and locals hate open windows). Although, one exception seems to be the\nAgadir\n-\nEssaouira\nroute, where even local buses are very fast. Probably due to the number of buses on this route and the desire to pick up as many passengers as possible along the way (not going to happen if overtaken by another company).\nBy e-hailing\n[\nedit\n]\nYou can hail a taxi or private car with the apps of Careem, Heetch, Roby and InDrive. Uber stopped operations in Morocco in 2018\n.\n(\nupdated May 2024\n)\nBy taxi\n[\nedit\n]\nGrand taxi\nTravel by taxi is common in Morocco. There are two sorts:\nPetit taxi\nused only within the area of the town\nGrand taxi\ncan be used for trips between towns, and for larger groups\nPetit taxi\n[\nedit\n]\nPrices for petit taxi are reasonable, and it's the law that taxis in town should have a meter—although they are not always on. Insist that the driver starts the meter, although in the more touristy cities drivers will refuse point-blank. If not, ask for the fare before getting in (but it will be more expensive). You can and should bargain the fare down, ideally to an amount for which you have exact change, as the driver often doesn't have it.\nThere often is a minimum fare for trips during the day and another during the night, both listed on a sticker along with other prices in the taxi. And because in some small cities, the metered fare is always lower than the minimum fare, trips are not metered there, and the price is fixed at the minimum fare. In such cities without metered taxis, those stickers are sometimes missing as well. Ask an uninvolved local whether there is such a minimum fare and how high it is (7 dirham is reasonable during the day, 10 at night).\nPetit taxis are not allowed to leave the city borders and is thus not an option for travelling between cities.\nGrand taxi\n[\nedit\n]\nGrand taxis are often 1970s and 1980s Peugeots and Mercedes\nThe grand taxi is a shared, generally long-distance taxi, with a fixed rate for specific route; the driver stopping and picking up passengers like a bus. Grand taxis are usually found near main bus stops. Negotiate on price if you want a journey to yourself and this will be based on distance travelled and whether you are returning—but price per taxi should not depend on the number of passengers in your group. When sharing grand taxi with others, drivers may cheat tourist-looking passengers charging higher—look how much locals around you pay; don't worry to ask other passengers about the normal price, before boarding or even when you're in.\nFares are semi-fixed and shared equally between passengers. However, there are six passenger seats per car not four (this is for the ubiquitous Mercedes, there are 8 or 9 seats in the bigger Peugeots in the southeast). Two people are expected to share the front seat, with four across the back. If you want to leave immediately or you want extra space you can pay for any additional empty seats. Grand taxis generally cost less than a luxury bus but more than the local bus. Late at night, expect to be charged a little more than at daytime, and also to pay for all the seats in the car as other customers probably won't show up that late.\nGrand taxis formerly were 10-year-old Mercedes, regular saloon cars that in Europe are used for up to 4 passengers plus driver. However, nowadays they are replaced more and more by Peugeot vans. For a grand taxi, it is normal to share a car between up to 6 passengers. The front seat is normally given to two women. Some travellers often pay for 2 seats that remain unoccupied to travel with more space inside, and hence comfort.\nBeware, some taxi drivers will refuse to drive off until the taxi is full, potentially causing you delays. Alternatively, for a relatively reasonable sum (depending on the driver), you can hire a grand taxi in Marrakech for the entire day, allowing you to explore the sights of the surrounding region. Most grand taxis operate only on a single route and that for trips outside of their licensed route they need to get permission from police first.\nTaxi owners vie with each other to add extras such as sunshades. A clean vehicle and smart driver is usually a good sign of a well maintained vehicle.\nGrand taxis can also be hired\nprivately\nfor approximately the price of two petit taxis for shorter trips. This is useful if your party is of four or more. If you plan to take a grand taxi for a custom tour it is best to book one day ahead to give the driver time to get this permission.\nBy plane\n[\nedit\n]\nDomestic flying is not a popular means of transportation; however, Royal Air Maroc, the national flag carrier, has an excellent but expensive network to most cities. Air Arabia is another choice. Starting in 2024, European low-cost carrier\nRyanair\noperates 11 domestic routes in Morocco between several cities for fares starting as low as 190 dirham, and may even beat the train on both speed and price in some cases, though with limited frequency and baggage allowances.\nBy tramway\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nCasablanca tramway\nis 30 km long, with 49 stops, and Y-shaped. Tickets cost 6 dirham; buy your ticket before boarding. You have a choice between a rechargeable ticket valid for 10 journeys only, or a rechargeable card, valid for 4 years.\nThis is, after the\nRabat-Salé tramway\n, the second tram system in Morocco, but also the largest system in number of stations and the length of the route.\nBy car\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nDriving in Morocco\nIn many ways the traffic culture is different from what you would experience in western countries. The main road network is in good condition but due to the lack of dedicated cycling lanes and pedestrian paths in all but the largest cities, they are shared by many cyclists, pedestrians and horse-drawn vehicles.\nRoads have a good surface, although some are very narrow, in most cases only one narrow lane in each direction. Many roads in the south marked as sealed actually have only a central strip, one lane wide, sealed with wide shoulders to be used every time you meet oncoming traffic and this is a sensible economic solution in these areas of sparse traffic and long straight roads - except when you can not see oncoming traffic because of windblown dust!\nBy thumb\n[\nedit\n]\nHitching is a routine form of travel in Morocco. Particularly in large farm trucks which supplement income by picking up paying passengers. Price is about half that of a grand taxi. Expect to ride in the back with lots of locals."

However, the network is limited, though traveling to many of the tourist destination. Two of the main lines, which both operate hourly most of the day are the following:\nAl Boraq\nhigh speed rail\ntrain, traveling between\nTangier\nand\nCasablanca\nvia\nRabat\nand Kenitra.  Between Tangier and Casablanca, trains take about 2 hours 20 minutes to complete the journey.  Until further construction takes place, only the portion between Tangier and Kenitra is along high speed rail, where it travels at 300 km/h, and otherwise the trains travel around 160 km/h.\nLine between\nMarrakech\n, Casablanca, Rabat, Kenitra,\nMeknes\n, and\nFez\n.  While this is not a high speed train, much of journey is at 160 km/h.\nA branch line to Oujda starts at\nSidi Kachem\nlinking\nMeknes\nand\nFez\nto the main lines.\nThe rail network is operated by\nONCF\n[dead link]\n. Tickets can be purchased both online and at stations and they are very cheap compared to Europe. For examples, Casablanca to Marrakech: 146 dirham for second class, 180 first, 2 hours 39 minutes. The only drawback with Moroccan trains are that they are very frequently delayed, so don't count on the timetables if you are in a hurry.\nPeople are incredibly sociable and friendly on the trains in Morocco and you will find yourself perpetually talking to strangers about your journey. Each new person will advise you on some new place you should go or invite you to their home for couscous. Stations in smaller cities are often poorly marked, and your fellow passengers will be more than happy to let you know where you are and when you should get off. It's expected to greet (\nSalam\n) new passengers entering your compartment, and if you bring fruit, cake, etc., it's common to offer the other passengers something as well. If you spend a little extra for 1st class you increase your chances of meeting someone proficient in many languages.\nThere are three daily departures from Tangier, bound for either\nOujda\nor Marrakech, although all of them can be used to reach either destination as there are corresponding trains in Sidi Kachem using the opposite branch of the train coming from Tangier. The night trains between Tangier and Marrakech offer couchettes for an extra 100 dirham. This is the only option if you would like to lie down sleeping as there are obstacles between the seats in regular compartments.\nIn summer, train compartments can be hot, with passengers standing everywhere when all seats are taken. First class train cars are supposed to have working air conditioning, however, not all train cars with air conditioning have it in working mode, so it's advisable to bring with you plenty of water (there are no vending machines on\nONCF\n[dead link]\ntrains, unlike SNCF or TrenItalia trains, and the conductor with a vending cart is not often easy to find). For example, the travel time between Tangier and Fez is about 5 hours and with no AC and no water, the ride can become unbearable in the summer desert heat.\nWhen you arrive at a station, to reaching the platform you'll need to validate your ticket (checkpoint at the entrance)."

The card also includes free admission to public museums and monuments, discounted admission for other tourist attractions, and additional discounts at some shops and restaurants. The card can be purchased at any tourist office, including at the airport, or purchased online for a discount and picked up on arrival at a tourist office.\nFor travellers not interested in the package, or staying longer than three days, the rechargeable\nSUMA 10\ncard provides a flexible means of getting around. It is valid for both metro and bus travel. This card allows for ten journeys, including transfers begun within 90 minutes of commencing your journey. The included transfers comprise unlimited transfers between metro (or tram) lines, and a single transfer to or from bus lines (i.e. between buses or to/from the metro). Cards are not personalized, and a single card can be used by multiple people (deducting multiple journeys, of course).\nThe SUMA 10 cards are sold in ticket offices in metro stations, and as of 2025 cost €8 (€4 until 30th June 25) for a single zone. There is an additional fee of €1 for a cardboard cart and €2 for a plastic card. The cards can be recharged at any metro ticket machine. Since 2022, this ticket replaces the previous\nBono transbordo\nand\nBonometro\ncards, so guides still referencing these are outdated.\nThe public transport network is divided into zones A, B, and + (see\nmap\n, ). There is a significant overlap between zones A and B. Most tourist destinations, including the beach, are located in zone A. Zone + consists solely of the airport.\nThe EMT (bus) website has a very helpful\nroute-planner\n[dead link]\n, useful for planning journeys not only by bus but also by metro, bicycle, and Valenbisi (see the bicycle section below).\nBy metro\n[\nedit\n]\nMetro Valencia\nThe\nMetro Valencia\nconsists of nine lines (three of which are tramlines) and connects the suburbs with the city. This metro system is not extensive, but can get you to major points within the city. Maps and timetables can be downloaded\nhere\n. In 2025, the one-way fare for a single zone is €1.50. The ticket costs an additional €1 and contains a rechargeable chip.\nMake sure to always keep your ticket, as you must present it when getting off as well. If you want to enter the tram, you must buy a ticket from the machine (at each tram stop), and then validate it\nbefore\nyou get on.\nIf you use the metro a lot, you should consider getting a 10-fare\nSUMA 10\ncard (see above).\nNOTE\nParts of the metro were closed following the October 2024 floods, for a current map click\nhere\n.\nStandard bicycles are permitted during the workweek only on portions of the network which operate above ground. On Saturday, Sunday and holidays they are permitted throughout, while folding bicycles may be transported at any time. No bicycles are permitted at all during Fallas and the night of San Juan. Pets in carriers and guide or personal assistance dogs are also permitted.\nBy train\n[\nedit\n]\nValencia has a Cercanías suburban rail network with\nfive lines\nradiating out from the\nEstació del Nord\nto well beyond the city. Note these trains are timetabled & ticketed separately to main line trains lookout for the\nsymbol. \nYou can pay for these trains with a contactless bank card at the ticket barriers.\nBy bus\n[\nedit\n]\nPublic EMT bus and Valencia Bus Turistic\nEMT\n[dead link]\nruns buses to virtually every part of the city, both day and night. A single ticket costs €2 (no transfers, 2025), payable to the bus driver on entry and can be paid in cash or with a bank card. (note: the EMT website is geo-blocked and only works when connected to a Spanish network)\nFor frequent travellers, a the rechargeable\nBonobús\ncard is available in kiosks and tobacco shops. It will allow you ten rides for €8.50 (as of early 2018). However, the\nSUMA 10\n, which is also valid and metro and tram lines, usually is the cheaper and more convenient option (see above). Bonobús cards can be recharged at\nkiosks\n[dead link]\nor online.\nFor travellers with smartphones, there is a very helpful official EMT app (iPhone and Android), which has a route planner and a QRT reader.\nMost bus stops now have digital displays listing the arrival times for the next bus. At those stops lacking the digital display it is still easy to find out the next arrival times, by using either a QRT reader (like the one built into the EMT app), or by sending a SMS with the unique number of the bus stop to a number displayed next to the posted route plan."

    "wiki_url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Madrid#Stay_safe",
    "text": "Stay safe\n[\nedit\n]\nMadrid is a very safe city, with some of the lowest crime rates among Europe's largest cities. The police is highly visible, and the city is equipped with cameras.  There are always people in the streets, even at night time, so you can walk across the city generally without fear. Travellers who remain aware of their surroundings, and keep an eye on their belongings, should have little to worry about.\nNeighbourhoods and suburbs\n[\nedit\n]\nAs with any place on earth, there are parts of Madrid and its metropolitan area that are less appealing and, consequently, less safe than others.\nThe Malasaña area, located north of Gran Via, is a lively bohemian neighbourhood, but it is also known to attract seedy crowds late at night.\nSome districts in the south (Carabanchel, Puente De Vallecas, Villaverde) and east (Ciudad Lineal) are marginally less well-off than the rest of Madrid, and they can give off an uneasy vibe to those unfamiliar with these places. They are safer than many \"bad neighbourhoods\" in other western European countries, but be on your guard at night. Most places within reach of metro stations are safe.\nSome of Madrid's suburbs to the south (Móstoles, Alcorcon, Parla) and east (Alcala de Henares) have fairly undeserved reputations to seediness. In reality, they are mostly safe, though it is always wise to stick to well-lit and crowded streets.\nFootball\n[\nedit\n]\nDespite the notoriously intense and politically-charged rivalry between Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, most people will not care if you wear an FC Barcelona football shirt, and in fact you will often see people (usually tourists) wear that shirt around the city. As Madrid is the capital city of Spain, it attracts people from all over the country, including Catalonia. One notable exception: on match days, do be careful, as violence has been known to occur between supporters of both clubs.\nFurthermore, there is a love/hate relationship between the two major football clubs in the city: Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid. Both are storied clubs with diverging identities; Real Madrid was always seen as the club of the elite, whereas Atletico Madrid is seen as the \"people's club\". Many fans and analysts believe that the \"Derbi Madrileño\" is more entertaining than \"El Clasico\", partially because of those differences in identity, but also because fans of the clubs have been known to engage in fiery arguments. If you ever see Real and Atletico fans argue, be careful if things start to escalate.\nOne of the lesser-known clubs in Spain, Rayo Vallecano is known for its very left-wing culture, traditions, and fan base. While games are usually fun and harmless, there have been reports of robberies in and around the Vallecas Stadium, which is located in the working-class neighborhood of Puente De Vallecas.\nPickpocketing\n[\nedit\n]\nMuch like other big European cities, Madrid has its fair share of nonviolent\npickpocket\ncrime, though it is nowhere near the stratospheric levels of cities like Rome or Barcelona. Always watch out for any belongings (mostly bags and wallets) you have with you, especially on the Metro and in busier public spaces. Some areas with acute pickpocketing problems include Gran Via (especially near Plaza de Callao and Calle de Fuencarral), Puerta del Sol, the Atocha train station, and the AZCA business district (though the latter has seen improvements in that regard). Some major night clubs like Kapital and Mondo Disko also attract pickpockets.\nPickpockets often create a distraction while an accomplice steals from you. Distractions include presenting a map and asking you for directions, or asking you to sign a petition - which is followed by a request for a donation. It is best to ignore any stranger that approaches you in the street asking for help. Be careful when carrying luggage as this can make you a target for pickpockets.\nOne prevalent and long-lasting issue in Madrid are street vendors, especially around Puerta del Sol. They are usually harmless and will take \"no\" as a sign that they should not bother you, but do not provoke them. Also, these street vendors react swiftly to police cars, so watch yourself whenever they run from the police.\nAt bars and restaurants never leave wallets or telephones on the table as possessions on show make for easy targets. Passing thieves create a distraction and steal the items. The area around Calle de las Infantes near Gran Via is particularly renowned for this.\nWhen using ATM machines, be aware of your surroundings, just as you would anywhere. Bring a friend if you need to withdraw cash after dark. If someone approaches you while using an ATM, hit CANCELAR, retrieve your card and move on.\nWhen going out, getting drunk can make you a target for thieves. Also keep an eye on your drink. Don't carry valuables on a night out.\nScams\n[\nedit\n]\nPlaza Mayor and Puerta del Sol might be beauties to look at, but they are Meccas for scams.\nAvoid people offering massages (\nmasajes\n); this is often a scam to extort money. Be firm and say\n\"No me toque\"\n(\"Don't touch me\") or\n\"No tengo dinero\"\n(\"I don't have any money\")"

Supratours buses offer specific tickets to link with the rail system and are bookable on the train company website as Supratours is run by it. All bus companies charge for baggage separately, however CTM is the only one that does this officially and provides baggage receipts. On Supratours, whoever takes your bag will demand up to 20 dirham (pay no more than 5 dirham). Do not pay for luggage that you can take aboard with you and that fits in the overhead locker of between your feet. Touts will try to charge you for that, strongly refuse.\nNearly every city has a central bus station (\nGare Routière\n) where you can buy tickets to travel from region to region (and in some cities certain companies run their own stations - mostly that applies to the operators CTM (\nGare Voyage\n) and partly Supratours). You can either choose the buses for tourists with air-conditioning and a TV. Or you can also take the local buses which cost only 25-50% of the tourist buses and are much more fun. They are not very comfortable, but you can get in contact with the local people and learn a lot about the country. The buses often take longer routes than the big ones, so you can see villages you would never get to as a \"normal\" tourist. For heat-sensitive people this is not advisable though, as locals may tell you that 35 degrees is \"cool\" and no reason for opening a window. The route from Rissani, Erfoud, and Er Rachidia to Meknes and Fez, while long, runs through the Middle and High Atlas and is particularly scenic.\nAt the large bus stations (\nGare Routière\n), always buy your ticket at the ticket window inside of the bus station. Otherwise you will mostly overpay. Several touts will approach you as you enter the bus station, and try to sell you a ticket. While a local will get a proper ticket with them (because they know the prices), tourists will most certainly be overcharged. Also, the ticket windows often (must) have prices and time tables displayed. You might get the ticket with the same guy that approached you in the beginning, but it will consequently be much cheaper.\nLocal intercity buses can be entered along the highway or main road, where you will pay the conductor. Always ask for the price before entering, and if too high, refuse. At least the conductors will understand, that you will not board if too high and give you a good price. Supratours and CTM buses will not stop anywhere for you to enter except for the main bus stations—the driver is not allowed to sell tickets.\nLuxury buses operated by\nCTM\nare also inexpensive and offer an easier travelling experience than local buses.\nSupratours\n, a major rival of CTM, complements the train network to Essaouira and all major Atlantic-coast towns south to Marrakech.\nCTM and Supratours tickets can often not be booked online directly with the bus operator using a foreign bank card. In this case, they can either be bought in person at the bus stations, or using\nMarrakech Tickets\n. Note that Marrakech Tickets will charge a significant fee and take a few hours (or even days) to process your request, which involves sending you an invoice by email.\nLocal intercity buses\nare a completely valid choice for the hardier traveller, and often even have more leg room than the luxury buses although this may be just because the seat in front of you is disintegrating. They can be extraordinarily slow as they will stop for anyone, anywhere, and only luxury buses are air conditioned (and locals hate open windows). Although, one exception seems to be the\nAgadir\n-\nEssaouira\nroute, where even local buses are very fast. Probably due to the number of buses on this route and the desire to pick up as many passengers as possible along the way (not going to happen if overtaken by another company)."

They are safer than many \"bad neighbourhoods\" in other western European countries, but be on your guard at night. Most places within reach of metro stations are safe.\nSome of Madrid's suburbs to the south (Móstoles, Alcorcon, Parla) and east (Alcala de Henares) have fairly undeserved reputations to seediness.

As Madrid is the capital city of Spain, it attracts people from all over the country, including Catalonia. One notable exception: on match days, do be careful, as violence has been known to occur between supporters of both clubs.\nFurthermore, there is a love/hate relationship between the two major football clubs in the city: Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid. Both are storied clubs with diverging identities; Real Madrid was always seen as the club of the elite, whereas Atletico Madrid is seen as the \"people's club\". Many fans and analysts believe that the \"Derbi Madrileño\" is more entertaining than \"El Clasico\", partially because of those differences in identity, but also because fans of the clubs have been known to engage in fiery arguments. If you ever see Real and Atletico fans argue, be careful if things start to escalate.\nOne of the lesser-known clubs in Spain, Rayo Vallecano is known for its very left-wing culture, traditions, and fan base. While games are usually fun and harmless, there have been reports of robberies in and around the Vallecas Stadium, which is located in the working-class neighborhood of Puente De Vallecas."

    "text": "By taxi\n[\nedit\n]\nGrand taxi\nTravel by taxi is common in Morocco. There are two sorts:\nPetit taxi\nused only within the area of the town\nGrand taxi\ncan be used for trips between towns, and for larger groups\nPetit taxi\n[\nedit\n]\nPrices for petit taxi are reasonable, and it's the law that taxis in town should have a meter—although they are not always on. Insist that the driver starts the meter, although in the more touristy cities drivers will refuse point-blank. If not, ask for the fare before getting in (but it will be more expensive). You can and should bargain the fare down, ideally to an amount for which you have exact change, as the driver often doesn't have it.\nThere often is a minimum fare for trips during the day and another during the night, both listed on a sticker along with other prices in the taxi. And because in some small cities, the metered fare is always lower than the minimum fare, trips are not metered there, and the price is fixed at the minimum fare. In such cities without metered taxis, those stickers are sometimes missing as well. Ask an uninvolved local whether there is such a minimum fare and how high it is (7 dirham is reasonable during the day, 10 at night).\nPetit taxis are not allowed to leave the city borders and is thus not an option for travelling between cities.\nGrand taxi\n[\nedit\n]\nGrand taxis are often 1970s and 1980s Peugeots and Mercedes\nThe grand taxi is a shared, generally long-distance taxi, with a fixed rate for specific route; the driver stopping and picking up passengers like a bus. Grand taxis are usually found near main bus stops. Negotiate on price if you want a journey to yourself and this will be based on distance travelled and whether you are returning—but price per taxi should not depend on the number of passengers in your group. When sharing grand taxi with others, drivers may cheat tourist-looking passengers charging higher—look how much locals around you pay; don't worry to ask other passengers about the normal price, before boarding or even when you're in.\nFares are semi-fixed and shared equally between passengers. However, there are six passenger seats per car not four (this is for the ubiquitous Mercedes, there are 8 or 9 seats in the bigger Peugeots in the southeast). Two people are expected to share the front seat, with four across the back. If you want to leave immediately or you want extra space you can pay for any additional empty seats. Grand taxis generally cost less than a luxury bus but more than the local bus. Late at night, expect to be charged a little more than at daytime, and also to pay for all the seats in the car as other customers probably won't show up that late.\nGrand taxis formerly were 10-year-old Mercedes, regular saloon cars that in Europe are used for up to 4 passengers plus driver. However, nowadays they are replaced more and more by Peugeot vans. For a grand taxi, it is normal to share a car between up to 6 passengers. The front seat is normally given to two women. Some travellers often pay for 2 seats that remain unoccupied to travel with more space inside, and hence comfort.\nBeware, some taxi drivers will refuse to drive off until the taxi is full, potentially causing you delays. Alternatively, for a relatively reasonable sum (depending on the driver), you can hire a grand taxi in Marrakech for the entire day, allowing you to explore the sights of the surrounding region. Most grand taxis operate only on a single route and that for trips outside of their licensed route they need to get permission from police first.\nTaxi owners vie with each other to add extras such as sunshades. A clean vehicle and smart driver is usually a good sign of a well maintained vehicle.\nGrand taxis can also be hired\nprivately\nfor approximately the price of two petit taxis for shorter trips. This is useful if your party is of four or more. If you plan to take a grand taxi for a custom tour it is best to book one day ahead to give the driver time to get this permission."

    "text": "Pickpocketing\n[\nedit\n]\nMuch like other big European cities, Madrid has its fair share of nonviolent\npickpocket\ncrime, though it is nowhere near the stratospheric levels of cities like Rome or Barcelona. Always watch out for any belongings (mostly bags and wallets) you have with you, especially on the Metro and in busier public spaces. Some areas with acute pickpocketing problems include Gran Via (especially near Plaza de Callao and Calle de Fuencarral), Puerta del Sol, the Atocha train station, and the AZCA business district (though the latter has seen improvements in that regard). Some major night clubs like Kapital and Mondo Disko also attract pickpockets.\nPickpockets often create a distraction while an accomplice steals from you. Distractions include presenting a map and asking you for directions, or asking you to sign a petition - which is followed by a request for a donation. It is best to ignore any stranger that approaches you in the street asking for help. Be careful when carrying luggage as this can make you a target for pickpockets.\nOne prevalent and long-lasting issue in Madrid are street vendors, especially around Puerta del Sol. They are usually harmless and will take \"no\" as a sign that they should not bother you, but do not provoke them. Also, these street vendors react swiftly to police cars, so watch yourself whenever they run from the police.\nAt bars and restaurants never leave wallets or telephones on the table as possessions on show make for easy targets. Passing thieves create a distraction and steal the items. The area around Calle de las Infantes near Gran Via is particularly renowned for this.\nWhen using ATM machines, be aware of your surroundings, just as you would anywhere. Bring a friend if you need to withdraw cash after dark. If someone approaches you while using an ATM, hit CANCELAR, retrieve your card and move on.\nWhen going out, getting drunk can make you a target for thieves. Also keep an eye on your drink. Don't carry valuables on a night out."

    "text": "Petit taxi\n[\nedit\n]\nPrices for petit taxi are reasonable, and it's the law that taxis in town should have a meter—although they are not always on. Insist that the driver starts the meter, although in the more touristy cities drivers will refuse point-blank. If not, ask for the fare before getting in (but it will be more expensive). You can and should bargain the fare down, ideally to an amount for which you have exact change, as the driver often doesn't have it.\nThere often is a minimum fare for trips during the day and another during the night, both listed on a sticker along with other prices in the taxi. And because in some small cities, the metered fare is always lower than the minimum fare, trips are not metered there, and the price is fixed at the minimum fare. In such cities without metered taxis, those stickers are sometimes missing as well. Ask an uninvolved local whether there is such a minimum fare and how high it is (7 dirham is reasonable during the day, 10 at night).\nPetit taxis are not allowed to leave the city borders and is thus not an option for travelling between cities."

    "text": "See\n[\nedit\n]\nThe summit of\nEl Teide\nFor an island less than 100 km long, Tenerife boasts as surprising variety of landscapes, biomes, and climates. Thanks to the climate altering effects of its volcanic mountain ranges, hot arid climates in the south transition to wet and cool climates in the north and east of the island. This makes Tenerife a formidable holiday destination, because visitors are rewarded with many different views without having to spend considerable time travelling.\nNature\n[\nedit\n]\nUnsurprisingly, much of the appeal of Tenerife comes from its numerous natural treasures. Almost a third of the islands area is protected and well preserved. It is an island of contrasts. The northern and eastern regions of the island are green and covered with forests and banana plantations alike, with flowers in every imaginable colour blooming almost around the year. The charms of the misty forests and lush vegetation make the northern half of the island a paradise loved by millions of visitors every year. The southern region of Tenerife has a very arid and hot climate, and most of it is a desert landscape with little vegetation aside from cacti, woody shrubs, and countless wind turbines. This vast region is sparsely populated and has little to offer to tourists except the brutal hardships of its desert climate, and the fauna and flora that have adapted to it.\nOf particular interest are the following national and nature parks:\nEchium wildpretii\n, a flower unique to Tenerife that only grows on El Teide\nTeide National Park\n– Best known for volcano\nEl Teide\n(3,715 m) at its heart, surrounded by desolate landscapes of lava rock. El Teide is not only the highest mountain on the\nCanary Islands\nbut in all of\nSpain\n. Over 4 million visitors are attracted to the volcanic landscapes of Teide National Park annually, making it the most visited national park in\nEurope\n. The park occupies the entire interior of the island, and is a\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\n. The breathtaking volcanic landscape with black lava rocks are worth the journey up the mountain which takes around 90 minutes from\nLa Orotava\nor\nVilaflor\n. Travelling up the summit by\n28.25447\n-16.62586\n1\ncable car\nor hiking offers a fantastic view of Tenerife and neighbouring islands provided there are no clouds. It is also one of the best locations on the planet to observe the sky, and a visit to the\nTeide Observatory\nis a highlight of any visit for astronomy enthusiasts. There is a free visitor centre for Teide National Park in\nLa Orotava\nthat is worth a visit.\nAnaga Rural Park\n– Covers 140 km² in the north-east of the island and has been a Protected Biosphere since 2015 because it is home to the largest number of endemic species in Europe. It is best known for its mist forests, and numerous tiny villages that have largely preserved their historic life style.\nTeno Rural Park\n– On the opposite side of Tenerife, covering most of the western tip of the island. It has a mountainous landscape abruptly ending in the ocean with tall cliffs called\nLos Gigantes\n. The best known settlement in the park is\nMasca\n, the islands most picturesque village.\nCorona Forrestal Natural Park\n– Covers large swaths of forest of Canarian pine trees on the slopes of El Teide, and is with an area of 410 km² the largest protected area on the Canary Islands. It stretches from an altitude of 300 m up to 2,715 m.\nVolcanic activity has also created some of the largest volcanic cave systems, the\n28.352089\n-16.704047\n2\nWind Cave\nnear Icod de los Vinos. With a length of 17 km it is the largest system in Europe and 5th in the world, after those of\nHawaii\n. A tour around the cave takes visitors into the heart of the volcano. Places are limited so make sure to book tickets online well in advance.\nDrago Milenario\nof\nIcod de los Vinos\nTenerife is home to hundreds of endemic species of fauna and flora, including beautiful flowers such as the bright red\nEchium wildpretii\nonly found on El Teide, lizards, birds, and cacti. Among the most recognizable ones are drago trees, which can grow up to several hundreds of years old. The most famous one is the\n28.366556\n-16.722222\n3\nDrago Milenario\nin\nIcod de los Vinos\n, said to be over a thousand years old and one of the symbols of Tenerife since it became a national monument in 1917. Drago tree seeds can be purchased in many gift shops on the island, offering the chance to take home a unique live souvenir without harming the islands natural beauty.\nThe variety in foliage resulting from Tenerife's many different climates is easily recognizable by the many species of trees that can be seen growing in the wild. Canary pine trees, drago trees, and the iconic Canary palm trees are examples of flora unique to the archipelago. All of the endemic palm tree species, complemented by dozens of exotic species, are on display in the\n28.451944\n-16.255833\n4\nPalmetum\nin\nSanta Cruz\n. The park is in the heart of the capital, and a must see for nature lovers. It features different biomes for palm trees, ranging from arid to an entire artificial rain forest, and offers fantastic views over the ocean and the city itself.\nMuch of Tenerifes wildlife is difficult to observe in the wild for tourists, especially aquatic animals roaming the oceans. A recommendable alternative is\n28.408333\n-16.564167\n5\nLoro Parque\n, regarded as the best zoo in the world in 2018 and with over a million visitors annually the most popular attraction on the archipelago. Loro Parque was established in the 1970s as a paradise for parrots, and has since grown into a sanctuary for fauna and flora including over 4,000 parrots of 350 different species. It is also home to dolphins, sea lions, and orcas, the largest indoor penguin exhibition in the world, a massive aquarium with shark tunnel, and an orchid garden with numerous rare orchid species.\nCulture\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nPyramids of Güímar\nIn addition to its natural treasures, the island also has many architectural and cultural highlights. Tenerife has a long history dating back 2 millennia when the first settlers arrived from\nNorth Africa\n. These\nGuanche\ncave dwellers left many artifacts and structures, and many of their cave homes are still inhabited today in the southern regions of the island where they are a cooler alternative than above ground habitation. Some of the most remarkable remains predating Spanish colonisation are the\n28.320833\n-16.413611\n6\nstepped pyramids\nin the Ethnographic Park of\nGüímar\n, the most popular archaeological site on Tenerife. Just like their counterparts in\nEgypt\nor\nLatin America\n, the origin of the pyramids has been the subject of scientific debate, and the museum presents the hypotheses as a series of interactive exhibits. The 6 stepped pyramids and the museum are well worth a visit.\nThe Guanche aborigines also had burial rites involving mummification of their dead, and numerous mummies have been found by archaeologists across the island such as in the\nBarranco de Badajoz\n. Many are on display in the\nMuseum of Nature and Archaeology\nin\nSanta Cruz\n.\nSpanish colonisation in 1496 brought cultural revolution to Tenerife, as Spanish settlers began construction of towns and cities that mirrored their homeland. Historic architecture is easily recognizable as Spanish, with several unique\nLatin American\ntouches in its finishing. The historic capital city\n28.48904\n-16.31671\n7\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\nis a\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\nwith a completely pedestrianized historic centre. It is a paradise for architecture enthusiasts with well preserved religious and residential masterpieces concentrated in a handful of streets. The many estates, belonging to early\nconquistadores\n, have beautifully restored facades and inner courtyards that are often open to the public. The renovated\nCasa Salazar\nis one of the finest examples, completely erected in cut volcanic rock. The\ncathedral\nin a Spanish colonial style has been transformed in a museum of religious art, complete with audio guide. Taking a walk down the\nCalle San Agustín\ngives a fair impression of what life in a colonial city must have been like. For those less interested in history and architecture, the\nMuseum of Science and Cosmos\nis only a few tram stops away from the historic centre, has a radio telescope and planetarium, and is one of the few indoor attractions in the event of rainy weather.\nThe\nBasilica\nof\nCandelaria\nCatholicism introduced by the Spanish colonists gave rise to countless chapels and churches on Tenerife, and nearly ever village, town or city has one or more that are worth visiting. The most spectacular of all is the\n28.35128\n-16.369782\n8\nBasilica of Candelaria\n, which looks out over the Atlantic Ocean, and is an attraction that should not be missed. The Basilica receives over 2.5 million visitors annually and is the most prominent tourist attraction in the southern region of Tenerife. The square in front of the basilica is decorated with bronze statues of each of the Guanche kings. Each February it is the scene of an elaborate parade with historic fancy dresses empowered by the locals, which has also spread to\nSanta Cruz\nand\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\n. It is said to be the third largest carnival scene after\nRio de Janeiro\nand\nNotting Hill\n.\nLess famous than\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\nis\n28.39068\n-16.52416\n9\nLa Orotava\n, a very stately historic city on the slopes of El Teide. La Orotava has a wealth of attractions to offer to those prepared to explore its narrow and steep streets, such as\nCasa de los Balcones\n, a small museum housed in an estate mansion dedicated to the life style in Tenerifes colonial era. And there is no better place to rest out after another day in paradise than having a\nbarraquito\nin the lounge sofas of nearby\nCasa Lercaro\n!"

    "text": "Grand taxi\n[\nedit\n]\nGrand taxis are often 1970s and 1980s Peugeots and Mercedes\nThe grand taxi is a shared, generally long-distance taxi, with a fixed rate for specific route; the driver stopping and picking up passengers like a bus. Grand taxis are usually found near main bus stops. Negotiate on price if you want a journey to yourself and this will be based on distance travelled and whether you are returning—but price per taxi should not depend on the number of passengers in your group. When sharing grand taxi with others, drivers may cheat tourist-looking passengers charging higher—look how much locals around you pay; don't worry to ask other passengers about the normal price, before boarding or even when you're in.\nFares are semi-fixed and shared equally between passengers. However, there are six passenger seats per car not four (this is for the ubiquitous Mercedes, there are 8 or 9 seats in the bigger Peugeots in the southeast). Two people are expected to share the front seat, with four across the back. If you want to leave immediately or you want extra space you can pay for any additional empty seats. Grand taxis generally cost less than a luxury bus but more than the local bus. Late at night, expect to be charged a little more than at daytime, and also to pay for all the seats in the car as other customers probably won't show up that late.\nGrand taxis formerly were 10-year-old Mercedes, regular saloon cars that in Europe are used for up to 4 passengers plus driver. However, nowadays they are replaced more and more by Peugeot vans. For a grand taxi, it is normal to share a car between up to 6 passengers. The front seat is normally given to two women. Some travellers often pay for 2 seats that remain unoccupied to travel with more space inside, and hence comfort.\nBeware, some taxi drivers will refuse to drive off until the taxi is full, potentially causing you delays. Alternatively, for a relatively reasonable sum (depending on the driver), you can hire a grand taxi in Marrakech for the entire day, allowing you to explore the sights of the surrounding region. Most grand taxis operate only on a single route and that for trips outside of their licensed route they need to get permission from police first.\nTaxi owners vie with each other to add extras such as sunshades. A clean vehicle and smart driver is usually a good sign of a well maintained vehicle.\nGrand taxis can also be hired\nprivately\nfor approximately the price of two petit taxis for shorter trips. This is useful if your party is of four or more. If you plan to take a grand taxi for a custom tour it is best to book one day ahead to give the driver time to get this permission."

    "text": "By bicycle\n[\nedit\n]\nValenbisi station\nValencia is essentially flat, and cycling has become a popular way for visitors to get around. The city has established a comprehensive network of dedicated bicycle paths and lanes, and the Turia river park very conveniently cuts across the city, making it possible to get from one end to the other with minimal time in traffic. Drivers are now accustomed to interacting with cyclists in traffic, although pedestrians still occasionally wander into bike paths. Riding on sidewalks without demarcated bicycle paths is not permitted, but this is generally not enforced. At night lights are required, and a helmet and reflective vest are recommended. A bicycle route map can be downloaded\nhere\n[dead link]\n.\nThe city operates\nValenbisi\n, a popular bicycle sharing program, with 275 stations distributed throughout the city. No reservation is necessary – once you have a Valenbisi card, go to the interactive station terminal, follow the instructions in Valencian, Spanish or English, and choose a bicycle. You can return the bicycle to the same or any other station with available docks.\nA short-term subscription costs €13.04 and gives you access to unlimited use of the bikes for 7 days; the first half-hour of any journey is free, then €1.04 is charged for the first two additional half-hours, with €3.12 charged for every additional hour. However, if you park the bicycle in an available dock before the first half-hour is up, you can take out a new bicycle and reset the clock for no additional fees.\nWeekly cards can be purchased at any station terminal with a credit card. For periods longer than one week, an annual subscription is necessary and costs €27.12, with reduced tariffs for each additional half-hour. These cards must be purchased online and are sent by mail; however it is possible to bypass this hassle and attach your Valenbisi subscription to a valid\nBonometro\n,\nBonobús\n, or\nBono transbordo\ncard – see the website for details.\nThere are also many bicycle rental shops in town, with most charging around €10-15 a day, depending on season.\n39.47382\n-0.37401\n1\nDoYouBike\n,\nCarrer del Mar, 14\n(\nnear the cathedral\n),\n☏\n+34 963 155 551\n,\ninfo@doyoubike.com\n.\nDaily 09:45-14:00, 17:00-20:15\n.\nRents bikes.

These law enforcement agencies patrol both the center of Melilla and its peripheral areas, helping to maintain peace and order. There are also border controls and surveillance to ensure safety and compliance with laws.\nBorder area:\nThe proximity of Melilla to Morocco means that security in the border areas and city access points may be stricter, both for immigration purposes and the management of human and goods trafficking. Surveillance at these points is constant, designed to prevent issues such as irregular migration and smuggling.\nMelilla is a safe city to visit, though not unconditionally so. There are always lots of people enjoying the beach, etc. until late; though it is not advisable to travel alone at night, even in the city centre. Street robbery is not an uncommon occurrence for people walking alone at night in Melilla.\nPickpocketing is relatively common here, especially in public toilets where a common tactic is for a group of large men to crowd round the victim and basically empty every available pocket. It is a better idea to leave valuables with other friends before going to the toilet, or failing that, to surreptitiously tuck your phone/wallet into your socks."

    "wiki_url": "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Tenerife#Nature",
    "text": "Nature\n[\nedit\n]\nUnsurprisingly, much of the appeal of Tenerife comes from its numerous natural treasures. Almost a third of the islands area is protected and well preserved. It is an island of contrasts. The northern and eastern regions of the island are green and covered with forests and banana plantations alike, with flowers in every imaginable colour blooming almost around the year. The charms of the misty forests and lush vegetation make the northern half of the island a paradise loved by millions of visitors every year. The southern region of Tenerife has a very arid and hot climate, and most of it is a desert landscape with little vegetation aside from cacti, woody shrubs, and countless wind turbines. This vast region is sparsely populated and has little to offer to tourists except the brutal hardships of its desert climate, and the fauna and flora that have adapted to it.\nOf particular interest are the following national and nature parks:\nEchium wildpretii\n, a flower unique to Tenerife that only grows on El Teide\nTeide National Park\n– Best known for volcano\nEl Teide\n(3,715 m) at its heart, surrounded by desolate landscapes of lava rock. El Teide is not only the highest mountain on the\nCanary Islands\nbut in all of\nSpain\n. Over 4 million visitors are attracted to the volcanic landscapes of Teide National Park annually, making it the most visited national park in\nEurope\n. The park occupies the entire interior of the island, and is a\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\n. The breathtaking volcanic landscape with black lava rocks are worth the journey up the mountain which takes around 90 minutes from\nLa Orotava\nor\nVilaflor\n. Travelling up the summit by\n28.25447\n-16.62586\n1\ncable car\nor hiking offers a fantastic view of Tenerife and neighbouring islands provided there are no clouds. It is also one of the best locations on the planet to observe the sky, and a visit to the\nTeide Observatory\nis a highlight of any visit for astronomy enthusiasts. There is a free visitor centre for Teide National Park in\nLa Orotava\nthat is worth a visit.\nAnaga Rural Park\n– Covers 140 km² in the north-east of the island and has been a Protected Biosphere since 2015 because it is home to the largest number of endemic species in Europe. It is best known for its mist forests, and numerous tiny villages that have largely preserved their historic life style.\nTeno Rural Park\n– On the opposite side of Tenerife, covering most of the western tip of the island. It has a mountainous landscape abruptly ending in the ocean with tall cliffs called\nLos Gigantes\n. The best known settlement in the park is\nMasca\n, the islands most picturesque village.\nCorona Forrestal Natural Park\n– Covers large swaths of forest of Canarian pine trees on the slopes of El Teide, and is with an area of 410 km² the largest protected area on the Canary Islands. It stretches from an altitude of 300 m up to 2,715 m.\nVolcanic activity has also created some of the largest volcanic cave systems, the\n28.352089\n-16.704047\n2\nWind Cave\nnear Icod de los Vinos. With a length of 17 km it is the largest system in Europe and 5th in the world, after those of\nHawaii\n. A tour around the cave takes visitors into the heart of the volcano. Places are limited so make sure to book tickets online well in advance.\nDrago Milenario\nof\nIcod de los Vinos\nTenerife is home to hundreds of endemic species of fauna and flora, including beautiful flowers such as the bright red\nEchium wildpretii\nonly found on El Teide, lizards, birds, and cacti. Among the most recognizable ones are drago trees, which can grow up to several hundreds of years old. The most famous one is the\n28.366556\n-16.722222\n3\nDrago Milenario\nin\nIcod de los Vinos\n, said to be over a thousand years old and one of the symbols of Tenerife since it became a national monument in 1917. Drago tree seeds can be purchased in many gift shops on the island, offering the chance to take home a unique live souvenir without harming the islands natural beauty.\nThe variety in foliage resulting from Tenerife's many different climates is easily recognizable by the many species of trees that can be seen growing in the wild. Canary pine trees, drago trees, and the iconic Canary palm trees are examples of flora unique to the archipelago. All of the endemic palm tree species, complemented by dozens of exotic species, are on display in the\n28.451944\n-16.255833\n4\nPalmetum\nin\nSanta Cruz\n. The park is in the heart of the capital, and a must see for nature lovers. It features different biomes for palm trees, ranging from arid to an entire artificial rain forest, and offers fantastic views over the ocean and the city itself.\nMuch of Tenerifes wildlife is difficult to observe in the wild for tourists, especially aquatic animals roaming the oceans. A recommendable alternative is\n28.408333\n-16.564167\n5\nLoro Parque\n, regarded as the best zoo in the world in 2018 and with over a million visitors annually the most popular attraction on the archipelago. Loro Parque was established in the 1970s as a paradise for parrots, and has since grown into a sanctuary for fauna and flora including over 4,000 parrots of 350 different species. It is also home to dolphins, sea lions, and orcas, the largest indoor penguin exhibition in the world, a massive aquarium with shark tunnel, and an orchid garden with numerous rare orchid species."

    "text": "Culture\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nPyramids of Güímar\nIn addition to its natural treasures, the island also has many architectural and cultural highlights. Tenerife has a long history dating back 2 millennia when the first settlers arrived from\nNorth Africa\n. These\nGuanche\ncave dwellers left many artifacts and structures, and many of their cave homes are still inhabited today in the southern regions of the island where they are a cooler alternative than above ground habitation. Some of the most remarkable remains predating Spanish colonisation are the\n28.320833\n-16.413611\n1\nstepped pyramids\nin the Ethnographic Park of\nGüímar\n, the most popular archaeological site on Tenerife. Just like their counterparts in\nEgypt\nor\nLatin America\n, the origin of the pyramids has been the subject of scientific debate, and the museum presents the hypotheses as a series of interactive exhibits. The 6 stepped pyramids and the museum are well worth a visit.\nThe Guanche aborigines also had burial rites involving mummification of their dead, and numerous mummies have been found by archaeologists across the island such as in the\nBarranco de Badajoz\n. Many are on display in the\nMuseum of Nature and Archaeology\nin\nSanta Cruz\n.\nSpanish colonisation in 1496 brought cultural revolution to Tenerife, as Spanish settlers began construction of towns and cities that mirrored their homeland. Historic architecture is easily recognizable as Spanish, with several unique\nLatin American\ntouches in its finishing. The historic capital city\n28.48904\n-16.31671\n2\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\nis a\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\nwith a completely pedestrianized historic centre. It is a paradise for architecture enthusiasts with well preserved religious and residential masterpieces concentrated in a handful of streets. The many estates, belonging to early\nconquistadores\n, have beautifully restored facades and inner courtyards that are often open to the public. The renovated\nCasa Salazar\nis one of the finest examples, completely erected in cut volcanic rock. The\ncathedral\nin a Spanish colonial style has been transformed in a museum of religious art, complete with audio guide. Taking a walk down the\nCalle San Agustín\ngives a fair impression of what life in a colonial city must have been like. For those less interested in history and architecture, the\nMuseum of Science and Cosmos\nis only a few tram stops away from the historic centre, has a radio telescope and planetarium, and is one of the few indoor attractions in the event of rainy weather.\nThe\nBasilica\nof\nCandelaria\nCatholicism introduced by the Spanish colonists gave rise to countless chapels and churches on Tenerife, and nearly ever village, town or city has one or more that are worth visiting. The most spectacular of all is the\n28.35128\n-16.369782\n3\nBasilica of Candelaria\n, which looks out over the Atlantic Ocean, and is an attraction that should not be missed. The Basilica receives over 2.5 million visitors annually and is the most prominent tourist attraction in the southern region of Tenerife. The square in front of the basilica is decorated with bronze statues of each of the Guanche kings. Each February it is the scene of an elaborate parade with historic fancy dresses empowered by the locals, which has also spread to\nSanta Cruz\nand\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\n. It is said to be the third largest carnival scene after\nRio de Janeiro\nand\nNotting Hill\n.\nLess famous than\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\nis\n28.39068\n-16.52416\n4\nLa Orotava\n, a very stately historic city on the slopes of El Teide. La Orotava has a wealth of attractions to offer to those prepared to explore its narrow and steep streets, such as\nCasa de los Balcones\n, a small museum housed in an estate mansion dedicated to the life style in Tenerifes colonial era. And there is no better place to rest out after another day in paradise than having a\nbarraquito\nin the lounge sofas of nearby\nCasa Lercaro\n!"

    "text": "By car\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nDriving in Morocco\nIn many ways the traffic culture is different from what you would experience in western countries. The main road network is in good condition but due to the lack of dedicated cycling lanes and pedestrian paths in all but the largest cities, they are shared by many cyclists, pedestrians and horse-drawn vehicles.\nRoads have a good surface, although some are very narrow, in most cases only one narrow lane in each direction. Many roads in the south marked as sealed actually have only a central strip, one lane wide, sealed with wide shoulders to be used every time you meet oncoming traffic and this is a sensible economic solution in these areas of sparse traffic and long straight roads - except when you can not see oncoming traffic because of windblown dust!"

    "text": "Do\n[\nedit\n]\nWhen planning your activities, keep in mind that during the weekend and on public holidays the locals will also head anywhere where tourists are having fun. At the same time, many bus lines will run at a reduced frequency. Hence, it can become crowded around Teide, the beaches and on the roads, so it may be wise to use these days for relaxing somewhere quiet and head out again on Monday.\nBeaches\n[\nedit\n]\nThe volcanic nature of the island mean that Tenerife offers few\nnatural sand beaches\n. Those that exist are characterised by black sand made of volcanic rock, and many of them (especially in the North) are largely inaccessible due to the steep cliffs. To satisfy the demand for sun-bathing space, resorts and artificial beaches have been created by the tourism industry in certain parts of the island – in some cases even with golden sand imported from elsewhere.\nSome of the best beaches of Tenerife are in the southwest,\nLos Gigantes\n, Playa San Juan 8 km south and Playa Abama just another kilometre south. Also, there is Fañabe, in the south with its golden sand, showers and excellent facilities. Also popular are Torviscas with its marina,\nPlaya de las Américas\nfor its grey blackish sandy stretches and\nLos Cristianos\n' yellow imported sand beach.\nCandelaria\nin the east has a small black shingle beach. Up north Puerto de la Cruz has several beaches with fine black sand, and\nSanta Cruz\n' golden sand has been imported for its Terasitas beach from the Sahara.\nBeaches close to touristic centres often have sun-loungers with parasols available to hire for the day, but if you are doing this for a few days it is probably better to just buy a parasol and some beach mats.\nDiving\n[\nedit\n]\nTenerife has numerous scuba-dive operators. The seas are diveable all year, with temperatures from 18°C in January to 25°C in August. Go around the harbour wall in Puerto de la Cruz for fantastic volcanic rock formations, or feed the stringrays at Las Galletas for something a bit different.\nEl Condesito\nis a vessel that sank near Las Galletas on the south coast of Tenerife and is now a popular dive site. The deepest point of the wreck is at 21 m and the shallowest at 6 m. Visibility can exceed 35 m. The hull, engine room and cabin used to be intact with only the bow having been torn away. Shoals of sardines may be seen at the top of the wreck, and large trumpetfish are often found around the propeller. It is not uncommon to spot barracuda, red sea stars, rays, octopus and eels within the wreck. There is a 36 m drop off nearby which is often dived by more experienced divers to see black coral before ascending to the El Condesito to decompress.\nOther water activities and tours\n[\nedit\n]\nAbundant\nsurfing\n(all around the island),\nkite boarding\n(El Médano),\nkayaking\n,\nspeed boat parasailing\nand\njet-ski\nopportunities can be found around the island.\nSnorkeling\n– Due to the many natural pools and the generally rough landscape from land to sea, wherever you go into the water, you can expect an exciting underwater world. So, it is a good idea to bring at least goggles and snorkel, and maybe fins if you can.\nPlaces known for its sea turtles, where there is a high likelihood to see them, are Alcalá's bay just in front of the center and Las Eras with its abundant sea grass attracting the turtles.\nSwimming\n– The island is popular with locals for its natural and sea water pools all around the island—swim in one of them while the ocean swaps new water in regularly. Popular destinations are:\nThe nudist\nCharco de la Laja\nnorth of Tejina,\nLas Rojas\njust north of the TF-5 right between\nLa Laguna\nand\nPuerto de la Cruz\nwith a large cave and an abandoned hotel complex looming over this place,\nCharco de la Laja\nin San Juan de la Rambla and\nCharco del Viento\njust 3 km west of it, and\nthe\nPiscinas Naturales de El Caletón\nin\nGarachico\n.\nBoat trips\n– A large number of companies offer boat trips for tourists, varying from a \"booze cruise\" on a cruiser offering lunch, drinks and watersports to a trip around the island on a sailing boat or catamaran. One of the main attractions is the chance to see whales and dolphins in the wild. Visitors on most trips spot whales; dolphins are not so much of a certainty but can be seen generally—often very close to the boat. Whale and dolphin watching trips run near from either Puerto Colon in\nPlaya de las Américas\n, from the port at\nLos Cristianos\n, and from\nLos Gigantes\n. Most operators offer a free bus service from the larger hotels in the main resorts.\nSubmarine tour\n– The\nSub Fun Cinco\nis based at the San Miguel marina, just between Costa del Silencio and the southern airport. The spacious submarine will take you down to 30 m where you can observe barracudas, stingrays and other marine life in their natural habitat.\nBig game fishing\n– The Canary Islands are one of the best spots in the world for this type of fishing, and a number of companies offer fishing trips in Tenerife. While blue marlin are the most highly prized trophy fish there are plenty of other species including white marlin, wahoo, dorado, yellow-fin tuna, and mako and hammerhead sharks. Regular catches of blue marlin range from 150–225 kg with last year's record standing at 360 kg. Trips cost around\n€45\nincluding all equipment, but excluding lunch.\nHiking\n[\nedit\n]\nEven though\nLa Gomera\nis known by many for its great hiking, the variety offered by Tenerife can easily outmatch La Gomera. Tenerife is an excellent destination, and there are routes for everyone, from leisurely one hour strolls to extremely strenuous full day hikes with 2,000-3,000-m ascents or in demanding terrain with either a huge ascent, descent or both. There are 134 official hiking routes all over the island and many more wild paths and trails. The\nofficial website\nof the\nExcelentísimo Cabildo Insular de Tenerife (ECIT)\nlists official trails, camp sites and many more things interesting for hikers. Most importantly, they offer an\ninteractive map\nthat informs you about trail closures due to natural hazards such as rock slides or the 2023 wildfires.\nThere are several books describing hiking routes,\nblogs\nor just Openstreetmap and Wikiloc or various other mapping services as a guide available—of course it always helps to align with other enthusiastic hikers. Furthermore, there is the\nwebsite of\nCabildo de Tenerife\nwhere you find tours, hikes and camp site that you have to reserve, but it is hard to navigate through—though maybe that is because there are just not that many things to reserve with the council.\nThese are the most interesting hikes:\nTeide\nand/or\nPico Viejo\n– A demanding hike that requires a little preparation, even if it's just mentally. Beside that, the crater offer various other hiking opportunities reachable by bus or car and doable on a smaller scale.\nAnaga Rural Park\n— A rain forest that can easily compete with La Gomera, and a fantastic place to go hiking with numerous destinations.\nTeno Rural Park\n– Includes many hikes through pristine forests, and highlights like Masca and\nPunta de Teno\n, the most western point with excellent views, with a lighthouse.\nRisco Verde\nis a must for an unforgetable sunset above the Masca village and gorge.\nLos Gigantes\n– A hiking hub for numerous destinations into the surround region, with the marvelous Los Gigantes cliffs right in front of it, and Masca and Teno Rural Park around the corner.\nVentanas de Güímar\n– An impressive hike through water tunnels along an almost vertical cliff at 1,000 m altitude above\nGüímar\n—definitely not a destination for people suffering from vertigo.\nBosque de Esperanza\n– A paradise for hikers, the forest is both mysterious and untouched by mass tourism. Its narrow mountain roads, great hiking trails, twisted fairytale woodland landscape, and breathtaking views are worth a visit on their own.\nMasca valley\n– Restricted to a few hikers during the weekend and only with permit. Starting at Masca village, going down all the way to a beach, in-between massive cliffs.\nPaisaje Lunar\n– Allows for an easy–medium difficult hike from\nVilaflor\nto the so-called\nmoon landscape\n.\nRoque del Conde\n– One of the most prominent mountains on the south coast with views to all sides.\nClimbing\n[\nedit\n]\nVilla de Arico\nis the climbing capital of the island with two hostels catering for international climbing enthusiasts. There is a local climbing shop for all necessary equipment and numerous climbing routes in close range of the town, like along the\nBarranco La Puente\njust behind the town. Check out\nTenerife Climbing House\nand\nBase Camp Ortiz\nfor more details.\nGet some professional advice before heading out anywhere for climbing. The rocks on the Canary Islands are very sharp, even the sandy ones. Some people have lost their finger tips due to going out too carelessly. Loose rocks and boulders can also be a problem within the local environment.\nCycling\n[\nedit\n]\nTenerife attracts a large number of cyclists all year around. Whether\nmountain biking\nor\nroad biking\n, Tenerife has plenty of beautiful roads and dirt tracks. If you want to avoid the hassle of bringing your own bike, you can rent bikes on the island, for example in Las Americas, El Médano or Puerto de la Cruz.\nCycling is hard to do casually although bikes are available to rent. The coastal roads are busy and there is little room for bikes except often in the gutter. However, if you like cycling up hills there are plenty of steep roads to climb as soon as you leave the coastline. For those less fit, one tour company offers a car trip to the top of El Teide with a cycle down, no pedalling required.\nTwo popular routes:\nCanal de Vergara\n– This MTB route follows the probably longest water canal on the island around Teide on about 1,500–1,000 m altitude, starting from above La Guancha and finishing near\nGuía de Isora\n.\nPista General de Arico / BC 4\n– 33 km down from the crater through pristine forest to\nVilaflor\n, with a gorgeous green canyon in the middle, where you most likely have to carry you bicycle.\nParagliding\n[\nedit\n]\nTenerife offers excellent opportunities for\nparagliding\n. The Canarian Air Sports Federation\nlists\nabout a dozen paragliding clubs on the Island, and if you don't fly yourself there are several companies that will take you on a tandem flight. Take off from the mountains, soar the uplifts and land on the beach! Peak season is from October to April, but you can fly all year round. Make sure to check in with the locals before taking off: there may be flight restrictions or weather phenomena you're not familiar with. Popular take-off points include:\nMt. Izaña\n– Down the Orotava valley with a beach landing in Puerto de la Cruz.\nIlfonche\n– Land at Playa La Caleta near Adeje.\nLa Corona\n– Fly over Los Realejos and land at Playa del Socorro.\nTaucho\n– Great for experienced pilots\nGüímar\n– All levels and landing at the beach\nVenues\n[\nedit\n]\nLoro Parque\n– Home to the world’s most important Parrot collection (Parrot Park) with over 300 species, an amazing seal show, Dolphin Show, Parrot Show, Aquarium with Shark tunnel, Gorillas, Chimpanzees, Tigers, Jaguars, Flamingos, Alligators, Tortoises, Orchid House, Gambian Market, a 'NaturaVision' Cinema and the worlds largest Penguinarium with a reproduction Antarctic climate within which 12 tons of snow falls a day. Great for kids, terrible for animals.\nSiam Park\n– Opened in 2008, this is a fantastic water park, created by the owners of Loro Parque. It has been beautifully designed, like a modern Lago Martianez! Look out for the 2-m high artificial waves. Also, check the ratings so you know what to expect, there are high times when you wouldn't want to go.\nTenerife Auditorium\n– An incredible building in Santa Cruz designed by the famous Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. It is highly recommended to tourists to visit this incredible structure and even to enjoy any of the concerts and events held in it."

This strong sense of belonging to the Spanish nation is deeply rooted within the population.\nSome Melillians also take offence at the term \"colony\", due to its connotations of a territory controlled by a foreign power without autonomy. As an autonomous Spanish city, Melilla holds a distinct political status, and its inhabitants take great pride in their self-governance and connection to Spain.\nAlthough there is a widespread belief that the Moroccan government contributes to some of the challenges faced by the city, there is no animosity directed at Moroccan individuals. Moroccan tourists and workers in Melilla generally experience no issues, as the relationship between the local communities and Moroccans remains peaceful and respectful."

Many travellers quickly leave this vibrant and modernist metropolis on a search for a more traditional Moroccan experience, but admiring the impressive colonial architecture, Hispano-Moorish and art-deco outlook of the city centre is actually time well spent.\nMarrakesh\n, known as the \"Red City\" and probably the most prominent former imperial capital, will leave you with memories to cherish for life. Spend your days wandering through the lively souqs, admiring the old\ngates and defense walls\n, see the Saadian Tombs, the remnants of the El Badi Palace and visit the Koutoubia Mosque with its 12th century minaret. However, when evening falls make sure to head back to\nJamaa el-Fnaa\n, the largest square in Africa, as it fills up with steam-producing food stalls.

So, it is a good idea to bring at least goggles and snorkel, and maybe fins if you can.\nPlaces known for its sea turtles, where there is a high likelihood to see them, are Alcalá's bay just in front of the center and Las Eras with its abundant sea grass attracting the turtles.\nSwimming\n– The island is popular with locals for its natural and sea water pools all around the island—swim in one of them while the ocean swaps new water in regularly. Popular destinations are:\nThe nudist\nCharco de la Laja\nnorth of Tejina,\nLas Rojas\njust north of the TF-5 right between\nLa Laguna\nand\nPuerto de la Cruz\nwith a large cave and an abandoned hotel complex looming over this place,\nCharco de la Laja\nin San Juan de la Rambla and\nCharco del Viento\njust 3 km west of it, and\nthe\nPiscinas Naturales de El Caletón\nin\nGarachico\n.\nBoat trips\n– A large number of companies offer boat trips for tourists, varying from a \"booze cruise\" on a cruiser offering lunch, drinks and watersports to a trip around the island on a sailing boat or catamaran. One of the main attractions is the chance to see whales and dolphins in the wild. Visitors on most trips spot whales; dolphins are not so much of a certainty but can be seen generally—often very close to the boat. Whale and dolphin watching trips run near from either Puerto Colon in\nPlaya de las Américas\n, from the port at\nLos Cristianos\n, and from\nLos Gigantes\n. Most operators offer a free bus service from the larger hotels in the main resorts.\nSubmarine tour\n– The\nSub Fun Cinco\nis based at the San Miguel marina, just between Costa del Silencio and the southern airport. The spacious submarine will take you down to 30 m where you can observe barracudas, stingrays and other marine life in their natural habitat.\nBig game fishing\n– The Canary Islands are one of the best spots in the world for this type of fishing, and a number of companies offer fishing trips in Tenerife. While blue marlin are the most highly prized trophy fish there are plenty of other species including white marlin, wahoo, dorado, yellow-fin tuna, and mako and hammerhead sharks. Regular catches of blue marlin range from 150–225 kg with last year's record standing at 360 kg. Trips cost around\n€45\nincluding all equipment, but excluding lunch."

A sheer endless number of tour providers are waiting for the willing-to-pay tourist.\nHop on a camel back for a trip through the golden\nSahara sand dunes\nat\nErg Chebbi\n, near\nMerzouga\n. Spend the night in a desert tent, under the incredibly starred sky. Somewhat less easy to reach but therefor also less crowded are the dunes of\nErg Chigaga\nnear\nM'hamid\n.\nHammams\n[\nedit\n]\nHammam in Chefchaouen\nThere are two types of Hammam (steam baths) across Morocco.\nThe first is the\ntourist hammam\n, where you can go and be pampered and scrubbed by an experienced staff member. As these are promoted only to tourists, they are the more expensive option with pricing usually around 150 dirham for a hammam. They are not proper hammams, but they are nonetheless enjoyable, especially for the timid. Your hotel can recommend a good one.\nThe second option is to visit a\n\"popular\" Hammam\n. Popular hammams are the places where the locals go. Ask the staff at your hotel where they would go.\nAt the popular hammams, you do it all yourself. To make the most of a popular hammam, you need to take a scrubbing mitten (available cheap in the souks), a towel, and some extra underwear (otherwise, you will be going home without any, as it will be sopping wet). Popular hammams are often only identified by tiles around a door and entrance way. If you do not speak French or Arabic, it could be a daunting, or at least a very memorable, experience. Men & women have either separate session times or separate hammams.\nNudity in a popular hammam is strictly forbidden\nfor men, so be prepared to wear your underwear or a bathing suit. For women, you'll see some wearing underwear and some going naked.\nWhilst in a popular hammam, you may be offered help and a massage from another person. It is essential to remember that this\nmassage is nothing but a massage\n, with no other intentions. Sexual contact or presumption of sexual contact does not occur in these places. If you accept a massage, be prepared to return the favour.\nNormal entrance prices for a popular hammam are\n7-15 dirham\n, a scrub will cost around\n30 dirham\n, and a massage another\n30 dirham\n.\nSports\n[\nedit\n]\nFootball:\nthe men's national soccer team play internationals at various venues. The top tiers for clubs are Botola 1 and 2, each with 16 teams, and an August-May playing season as in Europe.\nAfrica Cup of Nations is staged in Morocco 21 Dec 2025 – 18 Jan 2026, with 16 national men's teams competing. The host cities are Casablanca, Rabat, Tangier, Marrakesh, Agadir and Fez. European clubs are grumbling at this timing as they have to release their African star players for a month."

Tenerife is an excellent destination, and there are routes for everyone, from leisurely one hour strolls to extremely strenuous full day hikes with 2,000-3,000-m ascents or in demanding terrain with either a huge ascent, descent or both. There are 134 official hiking routes all over the island and many more wild paths and trails. The\nofficial website\nof the\nExcelentísimo Cabildo Insular de Tenerife (ECIT)\nlists official trails, camp sites and many more things interesting for hikers. Most importantly, they offer an\ninteractive map\nthat informs you about trail closures due to natural hazards such as rock slides or the 2023 wildfires.\nThere are several books describing hiking routes,\nblogs\nor just Openstreetmap and Wikiloc or various other mapping services as a guide available—of course it always helps to align with other enthusiastic hikers. Furthermore, there is the\nwebsite of\nCabildo de Tenerife\nwhere you find tours, hikes and camp site that you have to reserve, but it is hard to navigate through—though maybe that is because there are just not that many things to reserve with the council.\nThese are the most interesting hikes:\nTeide\nand/or\nPico Viejo\n– A demanding hike that requires a little preparation, even if it's just mentally. Beside that, the crater offer various other hiking opportunities reachable by bus or car and doable on a smaller scale.\nAnaga Rural Park\n— A rain forest that can easily compete with La Gomera, and a fantastic place to go hiking with numerous destinations.\nTeno Rural Park\n– Includes many hikes through pristine forests, and highlights like Masca and\nPunta de Teno\n, the most western point with excellent views, with a lighthouse.\nRisco Verde\nis a must for an unforgetable sunset above the Masca village and gorge.\nLos Gigantes\n– A hiking hub for numerous destinations into the surround region, with the marvelous Los Gigantes cliffs right in front of it, and Masca and Teno Rural Park around the corner.\nVentanas de Güímar\n– An impressive hike through water tunnels along an almost vertical cliff at 1,000 m altitude above\nGüímar\n—definitely not a destination for people suffering from vertigo.\nBosque de Esperanza\n– A paradise for hikers, the forest is both mysterious and untouched by mass tourism. Its narrow mountain roads, great hiking trails, twisted fairytale woodland landscape, and breathtaking views are worth a visit on their own.\nMasca valley\n– Restricted to a few hikers during the weekend and only with permit. Starting at Masca village, going down all the way to a beach, in-between massive cliffs.\nPaisaje Lunar\n– Allows for an easy–medium difficult hike from\nVilaflor\nto the so-called\nmoon landscape\n.\nRoque del Conde\n– One of the most prominent mountains on the south coast with views to all sides."

On the beaches (e.g. Playa del Verodal) there is a strong undercurrent away from the land. Also the bathing pools created by lava barriers (e.g. Charco Azul, Pozo de las Calcosas) are repeatedly (and surprisingly!) overrun by several breakers in winter.\nHiking can also be dangerous because of changes in the weather. Fog can rise suddenly and make orientation difficult. Rainfalls lead to falling rocks and often cause entire slopes to slide down, making steep stretches in particular impassable. Rockfalls can also block roads, meaning drivers and other traffic will have to take a detour.\nSpeaking of traffic, there's little of it and people often drive slowly. Locals sometime park in the middle of the street, blocking the traffic, when going to a shop or something so watch for this.\nCrime is hardly an issue on El Hierro. It's a rural area where \"everyone knows everyone\" and cars and homes are often left unlocked."

As these are promoted only to tourists, they are the more expensive option with pricing usually around 150 dirham for a hammam. They are not proper hammams, but they are nonetheless enjoyable, especially for the timid. Your hotel can recommend a good one.\nThe second option is to visit a\n\"popular\" Hammam\n. Popular hammams are the places where the locals go. Ask the staff at your hotel where they would go.\nAt the popular hammams, you do it all yourself. To make the most of a popular hammam, you need to take a scrubbing mitten (available cheap in the souks), a towel, and some extra underwear (otherwise, you will be going home without any, as it will be sopping wet). Popular hammams are often only identified by tiles around a door and entrance way. If you do not speak French or Arabic, it could be a daunting, or at least a very memorable, experience. Men & women have either separate session times or separate hammams.\nNudity in a popular hammam is strictly forbidden\nfor men, so be prepared to wear your underwear or a bathing suit. For women, you'll see some wearing underwear and some going naked.\nWhilst in a popular hammam, you may be offered help and a massage from another person. It is essential to remember that this\nmassage is nothing but a massage\n, with no other intentions. Sexual contact or presumption of sexual contact does not occur in these places. If you accept a massage, be prepared to return the favour.\nNormal entrance prices for a popular hammam are\n7-15 dirham\n, a scrub will cost around\n30 dirham\n, and a massage another\n30 dirham\n."

Current rates for these and other currencies are available from\nXE.com\nDirham banknotes, with Hassan Tower in the background (\nRabat\n)\nThe local currency is the\nMoroccan dirham\n, sometimes symbolised as \"\nDh\n\", \"\nDhs\n, \"\nDH\n\", \"\nدرهم\n, or the plural form of \"\nدراهم\n\" or \"\nDhm\n\" (ISO code:\nMAD\n). Wikivoyage articles will use\ndirham\nto denote the currency.\nIt's divided into 100 santime or centimes (c). There are coins in denominations of 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, 1, 2, 5 and 10 dirham, although coins smaller than 20c are rarely seen in circulation these days. Banknotes are available in denominations of 20, 50, 100 and 200 dirham.\nWhile the dirham is the only currency officially accepted in Morocco, some hotels may accept your euros and US dollars unofficially.\nTry to have as many small notes as possible, even accommodations tend to never have any change ready. But also in general, keep larger bills hidden separately, just in case.\nPrices in Morocco are quite stable, i.e. the references you find in this guide, even if a couple of years old, are very reliable.\nNote:\nDirham may generally not be exported or imported. A tolerance of 2,000 dirham applies to tourists; more information can be found at the\nMoroccan customs website\n.\nMoney exchange\n[\nedit\n]\nIt is illegal to take more than 2,000 dirham of local currency out of the country, so you can't buy dirham outside of Morocco. Airport security conduct periodic currency checks and will confiscate dirham to be taken out of the country. By law, exchange rates should be the same at all banks and official exchanges. Make a note of the exact rates before you go to make sure you're getting a fair deal.  Besides banks and dedicated exchange offices, major post offices provide exchange, and work until late hours.\nDon't expect to see many banks in the\nsouqs\nor\nmedinas\n, although in larger cities there are often an ATM near the main gates, and even one or two inside the large souqs (if you manage to find your way). You may also encounter \"helpful\" people who will exchange US dollars or euros for dirham. Unofficial exchange on the streets outside souqs or medinas doesn't seem to exist.\nWhile changing money from a common widely used currency (e.g. USD or Euros) to dirhams will be easy in cities regularly visited by tourist, changing from dirhams to another currency due to a number of barriers, which include:\nFor foreigners, the Official \"Bureau de Change\" won't change dirhams to other currency unless the foreigner has a receipt showing they changed at least that amount of currency into dirhams through a money changer.  An ATM withdrawal receipt will not be accepted as proof of currency conversion.\nExcept at Morocco's international airports, money changers are not permitted to change dirhams into a foreign currency, unless the person seeking the money change has a Moroccan identification card.\nIf you are flights in the early morning or late evening, money changers at the airport may all be closed.  For instance at Rabat airport, money changers do not open until 7 am.\nOn Sundays, if you are changing money to dirhams, non-bank money changers may not issue receipts.\nDue these barriers, it is recommended that you:\nIf possible, take flights out of the country during the daytime or early to mid evening.\nBring some foreigh currency and change it in Morocco, so that you can change what you have leftover at the end of your trip out of dirhams.\nPrior to changing money to dirhams, confirm that you will receive a receipt.\nMinimize the amount of dirhams that you will have at the end of your trip.\nATMs\n[\nedit\n]\nATMs can be found near tourist hotels and in the modern\nville nouvelle\nshopping districts. Make sure that the ATM accepts foreign cards (look for the Maestro, Cirrus or Plus logos)\nbefore\nyou put your card in. Also be aware that they are not refilled during weekends in smaller towns, so get enough cash for the weekend on Friday or Saturday morning.\nAs of March 2024, the Al Barid bank does not charge\nATM fees\n. Also for local banks it's more likely that withdrawing money is for free (apart from the fee your bank charges). About 30 dirham are charged for withdrawals by some banks  like Société Générale, BCME, Bank Populaire, BMCI (BNP Paribas), Attijariwafa and others. It could happen that an ATM does not display any fees, you don't get a receipt and on your bank account you notice that they charged anyhow. Talk to your bank and try to reject these fees to make this practice harder in the future.\nFor buying something: If there is no price tag,\nask for the price first\n.\nPayment at the airport\n[\nedit\n]\nIn event that you plan on spending your remaining dirhams at a Moroccan airport, please note that:\nPrices at the stores are shown in Euros, not dirhams.\nExpect that some stores will not accept dirhams and some may only accept dirhams for select items in the store.\nLike many countries' airports, the cost of some purchases may be multiple times the cost of buying it elsewhere.\nShopping\n[\nedit\n]\nWhat does it cost? (May 2019)\nOranges: 4 dirham/kg\nBananas: 8-10 dirham/kg\nMelon: 8 dirham/kg\nDates: 10-30 dirham/kg, depending on the quality\nDried Curcuma roots: 50 dirham/kg\nWater 1.5 l: 5-6 dirham\nCoke 0.5 l: 5.50 dirham\nThé a la menthe / cafe noir: 6-8 dirham\nTagin or couscous: 25-60 dirham, depending on how touristy\nGrand taxi: 50-60 dirham / 100 km\nBus: 20-30 dirham / 100 km\nDouble room: from 170-300 dirham\nPack of Marlboros: 35 dirham\nTobacco for shisha: 20 dirham\nArgan oil: from 20 dirham / 100 ml\nRhassoul/ghassoul ½ kg: 8 dirham\nSmall \"silver\" teapot (2-3 cups): 10-15 dirham + 30 dirham for heat glove\nWhat\n[\nedit\n]\nSouvenir shop in the souq of Marrakech\nApart from classic tourist souvenirs like postcards and trinkets, here are some things from this region that are hard to find elsewhere, or even unique:\nBirad\n– Classic Moroccan tea pots.\nCarpets\n– Genuine handmade Berber carpets can be purchased direct from the artisans who weave them. If you go to small villages, such as Anzal, in the province of Ouarzazate, you can visit the weavers, watch them work, and they will happily serve you tea and show you their products.\nDates\n– 10 dirham for an orange box seems an adequate price after some bargaining. However, in Europe dates are quite cheap as well, especially when bought at Middle Eastern or Turkish shops. In the end, how much sugar is really good for you?\nDjellabah\n– Classic Moroccan designer robe with a hood. Often come in intricate designs and some are suited for warm weather while other heavier styles are for the cold.\nLeatherware\n– Morocco has a really huge production of leather goods. Markets are full of mediocre models (you will notice that they use the same cuts and zippers for all the different types of cloths) and designer shops are hard to find. Instead, maybe you want to opt for pure leather itself and do the good work yourself back home—purses, vests, whatever ... stitching and sewing is becoming more and more popular in Europe again.\nRhassoul/ghassoul\n– Also called wash soil in Europe, where it costs about 10 times as much as in Morocco.\nT-shirts\n– If you're looking for T-shirts, consider designer items by Kawibi—they look much more inspiring than boring traditional set of themes. They are available in duty-free stores, Atlas Airport Hotel near Casablanca and other places.\nSpices and black soap:\nMorocco is famous for its spices and you will see black soap at every herbs shops in the Medinas. Although spices markets are beautiful and perfect for pictures, the cheapest place to buy them is probably Carrefour. If you get the chance, go to the big supermarkets 5 - 10 km outside the centre of the cities, where you will find the same spices they sell in the Medina, but for one tenth of the price!\nWhat not\n[\nedit\n]\nGeodes\n– Pink and purple dyed quartz are widely sold along with fake galena geodes which are often described as \"cobalt geodes\".\nTrilobite fossils\n– Unless you are an expert, you will most likely be buying a fake.\nArtesanal\nor\ncooperative\n– These are catch phrases put up for tourists and just mean an increased price, but not necessarily higher quality or higher sustainability. Such facts can barely be verified and whether an oil is good or not is a poker game. Either way, you are always better off buying where locals do, because there you can expect quality also locals would go for. Get advice from your ho(s)tel staff where to buy good quality and at what price, but never let them show you directly. And if they say it is their cousin or friend, it is better to avoid it. Then go around the market for even more asking and checking of the lower price barrier of the merchants. Only after that decide what to buy and at what price.\nArgan oil\n– Forget about it. It is impossible to tell whether you got something proper. Just because a lady in the shop is kneading stuff in oil, doesn't mean it is anyhow related to the oil they sell. Just because a pressing machine is inside the shop, and they claim using it to get the oil, does not mean they actually do. Just because your guide or the shop owner claim it is the best Argan oil around, doesn't mean it is. Just because they claim it is locally produced, organic (bio), artesanal, from a collective or has fancy logos and graphics, does not mean it is actually genuine—there is no such thing as a proper Moroccan certification. And just because the price is high does not mean either, it is good quality. Margins for Argan Oil are high, it is hard to identify genuine oil, and tourists are begging to be ripped off ... it only makes sense that this is a big scam you should avoid. Nevertheless, if you are really keen getting some oil, look up the price for Argan oil in Europe—it is about €16/250 ml. Only this is what you should use as base for bargaining. But you are probably better off not paying more than half than that in Morocco. Probably buying in a regular supermarket would be the best idea. Note that of course 100 ml bottles are sold at a far higher price (for tourists in little shops), because they can be carried as part of the hand luggage .... so, what really is the point in the end paying more than at home, and not even being sure about the quality?\nBargaining\n[\nedit\n]\nArtisan in the medina of Tangier\nRemember that\nbargaining\nin the souks is expected. It is not really possible to give an accurate indication of how much to start the bargaining at in relation to the initial asking price, but a general idea would be to aim for approximately 50% off. Prices are set on a daily, even hourly, basis, depending on how much has been sold on a given day (or period of hours), while also reflecting the vendor's personal estimation of the potential client. The souks are often a good reflection of the basic economic principles of supply and demand, particularly with regard to the demand side. If a lot of products have been sold by a particular merchant he/she will raise the price, and may refuse to sell any more products for the rest of that day (or for days) unless the price is much higher than usual. If there are many tourists around prices go higher and bargaining even small amounts off the asking price becomes quite difficult. In addition, the seller will generally inspect the client, whose dress and possessions (particularly if the potential client sports an expensive Swiss watch, camera, etc.) are usually the main indication of how high the price may be set above the usual. However, the potential client's attitude is also taken into consideration.\nTaking all this and other factors into account (such as the time of day, day of the week, season), initial prices may be up to 50 times or more in excess of normal prices, especially for more expensive items, such as carpets.\nCarpets\n, however, are a very specialized item and it is necessary to have at least a cursory understanding of production techniques and qualities. If possible, an ability to distinguish between hand-made and machine-made carpets, hand-dyes, and the like is helpful to avoid being utterly duped.\nBargaining is an enjoyable experience for most vendors\nand they prefer clients that don't appear hurried and are willing to take the time to negotiate. It is most often actually necessary to give reasons why you believe the price should be lower. The reasons you might give are limited only by your imagination and often lead to some very entertaining discussions. Common reasons may include: the price of the item elsewhere, the item not being exactly what you are after, the fact that you have purchased other items from the stall/store, that you have built a rapport with the vendor after discussing football and so forth. On the other hand,\nif there is little movement in the price after some time, the best advice is to begin leaving\n, this often has the result of kick-starting the bidding anew, and if not, it is likely that the merchant is actually unwilling to go further below a given price, however absurd.\nIt is also important to\nshow a genuine interest for the workmanship\nof the product for sale, no matter how uninterested you may actually be in what you are buying. This does not, however, mean that you should appear over-enthusiastic, as this will encourage the vendor to hold his or her price. Rather, it is important to project a critical appreciation for each article/object. Any defects are either unacceptable or a further opportunity to bargain the price down.\nYou should take caution to never begin bidding for unwanted items or to give the vendor a price you are unwilling or unable (with cash on hand) to pay. Try to avoid paying by credit card at all costs. In the event you do pay by credit card, never let it out of your sight and demand as many receipts as possible. There is typically a credit card carbon copy and an official shop receipt.\nNever tell a vendor where you are staying\nand\nnever tell a vendor how much you paid for any other purchases\n. Just say you got a good price and you want a good price from him or her too. It's best to be politely passive aggressive, sometimes for hours if you really want to save a few dirhams. And, above all, never be afraid to say 'No'.\nIt must also be said that, as is true for buyers, not all sellers are actually very good at what they do. A vendor that is completely uninterested or even aggressive is unlikely to give a good price. Move on.\nLast but not least, when you spend all of your holiday in the same place, especially in smaller, touristy towns: Vendors deal with tourists all the time. Most tourists buy souvenirs just before flying home, most tourists try the \"walk out\" trick as part of their bargaining strategies. It is not unheard of that tourists haggle for a carpet on a Friday, walk out and when they come back the next day, expecting a lower offer, the price actually increases. The vendor knows that you are likely to catch a flight the same day and that your second visit is actually your last chance to buy the carpet."

Current rates for these and other currencies are available from\nXE.com\nDirham banknotes, with Hassan Tower in the background (\nRabat\n)\nThe local currency is the\nMoroccan dirham\n, sometimes symbolised as \"\nDh\n\", \"\nDhs\n, \"\nDH\n\", \"\nدرهم\n, or the plural form of \"\nدراهم\n\" or \"\nDhm\n\" (ISO code:\nMAD\n). Wikivoyage articles will use\ndirham\nto denote the currency.\nIt's divided into 100 santime or centimes (c). There are coins in denominations of 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, 1, 2, 5 and 10 dirham, although coins smaller than 20c are rarely seen in circulation these days. Banknotes are available in denominations of 20, 50, 100 and 200 dirham.\nWhile the dirham is the only currency officially accepted in Morocco, some hotels may accept your euros and US dollars unofficially.\nTry to have as many small notes as possible, even accommodations tend to never have any change ready. But also in general, keep larger bills hidden separately, just in case.\nPrices in Morocco are quite stable, i.e. the references you find in this guide, even if a couple of years old, are very reliable.\nNote:\nDirham may generally not be exported or imported.

Airport security conduct periodic currency checks and will confiscate dirham to be taken out of the country. By law, exchange rates should be the same at all banks and official exchanges. Make a note of the exact rates before you go to make sure you're getting a fair deal.

You may also encounter \"helpful\" people who will exchange US dollars or euros for dirham. Unofficial exchange on the streets outside souqs or medinas doesn't seem to exist.\nWhile changing money from a common widely used currency (e.g. USD or Euros) to dirhams will be easy in cities regularly visited by tourist, changing from dirhams to another currency due to a number of barriers, which include:\nFor foreigners, the Official \"Bureau de Change\" won't change dirhams to other currency unless the foreigner has a receipt showing they changed at least that amount of currency into dirhams through a money changer.  An ATM withdrawal receipt will not be accepted as proof of currency conversion.\nExcept at Morocco's international airports, money changers are not permitted to change dirhams into a foreign currency, unless the person seeking the money change has a Moroccan identification card.\nIf you are flights in the early morning or late evening, money changers at the airport may all be closed.  For instance at Rabat airport, money changers do not open until 7 am.\nOn Sundays, if you are changing money to dirhams, non-bank money changers may not issue receipts.\nDue these barriers, it is recommended that you:\nIf possible, take flights out of the country during the daytime or early to mid evening.\nBring some foreigh currency and change it in Morocco, so that you can change what you have leftover at the end of your trip out of dirhams.\nPrior to changing money to dirhams, confirm that you will receive a receipt.\nMinimize the amount of dirhams that you will have at the end of your trip.\nATMs\n[\nedit\n]\nATMs can be found near tourist hotels and in the modern\nville nouvelle\nshopping districts.

If the address you have been given points to a location in\nLos Cristianos\n,\nPlaya de las Américas\n, or\nCosta Adeje\n, you may want to look elsewhere – you'll be one or more hours (depending on whether you're travelling by car or TITSA bus) away from the nearest attractions.

Expect to pay hefty rates for a nice room close to the historic centre of\nSan Cristóbal de La Laguna\nor\nLa Orotava\n. A less glorious but more budget friendly alternative is searching for a hotel room in\nPuerto de la Cruz\n, where high rise hotel blocks were built in the 1960s and 1970s to accommodate for slob tourists.\nAnother alternative is looking for hotels in smaller, less popular towns such as\nTegueste\n,\nLa Esperanza\n, or\nSan Andrés\n. Accommodation there is generally cheaper, and has the added advantage of being less crowded. Those looking for a beach holiday will likely find something to taste in one of the brand new residential areas of\nPuertito de Güímar\n.\nCamping\n[\nedit\n]\nWild camping is not allowed in the National Park. However, this rule does not apply to camper vans or cars, and you can stay anywhere without issues, even in the most remote and beautiful places.\nAlong with a few commercial campsites, there are free communal campsites called\nacampadas\n. The acampadas are usually in the inland and above 1,000 m altitude. They often have water and toilets. To sleep at one free acampada, you have to book the night in advance on the\nwebsite of the town council\n(cabildo). Unfortunately, the website is only in Spanish, very slow and sometimes down. However, it won't be an issue if you don't reserve, especially if the site is not overcrowded or closed.\nAlso\nthis official website\nhas camp sites, recreational areas, and such listed.\nFurthermore, Tenerife is famous for its caves in the hippie community and some caves are luxuriously furnished with sofas and solar panels for digital nomads (many from Poland). In general, many people stay in remote places in caves or along the beach on Tenerife, like\nPlaya Los Patos\nnear Puerto de la Cruz or Hippie Beach near Costa Adeje. The chances of police patrolling such places is low and people staying there know that.\nEither way, always remember: Take nothing but pictures, and leave nothing but footprints."

Nevertheless, if you are really keen getting some oil, look up the price for Argan oil in Europe—it is about €16/250 ml. Only this is what you should use as base for bargaining. But you are probably better off not paying more than half than that in Morocco. Probably buying in a regular supermarket would be the best idea.

Examples are the large prickly pears cactus and agave, both originating from the Americas, but nowadays so common on Tenerife that they are often mistaken for native species. Among invasive animals are hedgehogs and termites. Few of them have natural enemies on the island, allowing them to replicate rapidly and taking over the entire ecosystem. When travelling to Tenerife, carefully check luggage for stowaway seeds and insects (including eggs and larvae). This is particularly a risk when travelling from a similar climate, giving stowaways a high chance of survival. If found upon arrival, dispose of them through incineration (can be as simple as burning with a lighter). If you believe exotic fauna or flora has already escaped, alert authorities immediately.\nConsider the scarcity of\nfresh water\non the island during your stay, and use rain water to wash clothes or flush toilets if your accommodation allows you to do so.\nIn some of the more remote places, you will find signs advising you to\nnot flush your toilet paper\n. That may mean that the old sewage system can't handle it, or that the untreated sewage will be dumped straight into the ocean. Your poop will dissolve and decompose quickly, but toilet paper will linger around much longer and may end up ruining someone's beach day at the other end of the island.

It is not really possible to give an accurate indication of how much to start the bargaining at in relation to the initial asking price, but a general idea would be to aim for approximately 50% off. Prices are set on a daily, even hourly, basis, depending on how much has been sold on a given day (or period of hours), while also reflecting the vendor's personal estimation of the potential client. The souks are often a good reflection of the basic economic principles of supply and demand, particularly with regard to the demand side. If a lot of products have been sold by a particular merchant he/she will raise the price, and may refuse to sell any more products for the rest of that day (or for days) unless the price is much higher than usual. If there are many tourists around prices go higher and bargaining even small amounts off the asking price becomes quite difficult. In addition, the seller will generally inspect the client, whose dress and possessions (particularly if the potential client sports an expensive Swiss watch, camera, etc.) are usually the main indication of how high the price may be set above the usual. However, the potential client's attitude is also taken into consideration.\nTaking all this and other factors into account (such as the time of day, day of the week, season), initial prices may be up to 50 times or more in excess of normal prices, especially for more expensive items, such as carpets.\nCarpets\n, however, are a very specialized item and it is necessary to have at least a cursory understanding of production techniques and qualities. If possible, an ability to distinguish between hand-made and machine-made carpets, hand-dyes, and the like is helpful to avoid being utterly duped.\nBargaining is an enjoyable experience for most vendors\nand they prefer clients that don't appear hurried and are willing to take the time to negotiate. It is most often actually necessary to give reasons why you believe the price should be lower. The reasons you might give are limited only by your imagination and often lead to some very entertaining discussions. Common reasons may include: the price of the item elsewhere, the item not being exactly what you are after, the fact that you have purchased other items from the stall/store, that you have built a rapport with the vendor after discussing football and so forth. On the other hand,\nif there is little movement in the price after some time, the best advice is to begin leaving\n, this often has the result of kick-starting the bidding anew, and if not, it is likely that the merchant is actually unwilling to go further below a given price, however absurd.\nIt is also important to\nshow a genuine interest for the workmanship\nof the product for sale, no matter how uninterested you may actually be in what you are buying. This does not, however, mean that you should appear over-enthusiastic, as this will encourage the vendor to hold his or her price. Rather, it is important to project a critical appreciation for each article/object. Any defects are either unacceptable or a further opportunity to bargain the price down.\nYou should take caution to never begin bidding for unwanted items or to give the vendor a price you are unwilling or unable (with cash on hand) to pay. Try to avoid paying by credit card at all costs. In the event you do pay by credit card, never let it out of your sight and demand as many receipts as possible. There is typically a credit card carbon copy and an official shop receipt.\nNever tell a vendor where you are staying\nand\nnever tell a vendor how much you paid for any other purchases\n. Just say you got a good price and you want a good price from him or her too. It's best to be politely passive aggressive, sometimes for hours if you really want to save a few dirhams. And, above all, never be afraid to say 'No'.\nIt must also be said that, as is true for buyers, not all sellers are actually very good at what they do. A vendor that is completely uninterested or even aggressive is unlikely to give a good price. Move on.\nLast but not least, when you spend all of your holiday in the same place, especially in smaller, touristy towns: Vendors deal with tourists all the time. Most tourists buy souvenirs just before flying home, most tourists try the \"walk out\" trick as part of their bargaining strategies. It is not unheard of that tourists haggle for a carpet on a Friday, walk out and when they come back the next day, expecting a lower offer, the price actually increases. The vendor knows that you are likely to catch a flight the same day and that your second visit is actually your last chance to buy the carpet."

Do not take electrical devices, credit cards or large amounts of cash to the beach if you plan to leave your goods unattended while swimming. Take note that when walking through Playas De Las Americas, there is a lot of clubs round here and some drunkenness in the night hours. Many mobile phones have already been snatched around the island from drunken lads, especially at night. Taxis are widely available, and not too badly priced.\nCar break-ins\n[\nedit\n]\nMasca is well known for tourists getting broken into their car and having mobiles and other valuables stolen. Thieves will even try to use stolen mobiles to extract money via credit card or other payment services. Also other crowded tourist spots are prone to such issues. Hence, never leave anything in open sight.\nScratchcard touts\n[\nedit\n]\nIf you are holidaying in Tenerife you are probably going to be approached by \"scratchcard touts\" whose main aim is to part you with several thousand pounds for worthless contracts for time-share apartments. This view is backed up by the UK's Office of Fair Trading who suggest that every year 400,000\nUK consumers\nfall victim to these scams in destinations such as Tenerife, the Costa del Sol and Gran Canaria. On average each victim loses more than £3,000. Bogus \"scratchcard touts\" offer cards that will always be a winner, but to collect their prize, people need to attend a lengthy presentation and are persuaded into signing a contract for an \"exclusive\" club on the basis of false claims as to the price, range and quality of holidays available. The OFT's is advising people to ask three simple questions: can you take away the contract to consider at your leisure? Is everything you were promised in the presentation in the contract? Do you know exactly what you are getting for your money? If the answer to any of these questions is no, then simply walk away.\nElectronics shops\n[\nedit\n]\nMany, many shops on the island selling electrical and optical goods as well as cameras. You may think you are getting a bargain from these smooth talking salesmen but you aren't. You will overpay for something you could buy cheaper at home and even cheaper off eBay. Your goods may be faulty. Your guarantee will probably be worthless. These shops are everywhere in the tourist areas and so many people have been cheated by them for so many years.\nFlying vendors\n[\nedit\n]\nThe other main irritant on Tenerife are the Lookey Lookey men who try to sell you sunglasses, watches, jewellery and other cheap knick-knacks known as Lucky Luckies. They are quite harmless and generally don´t mean to cause trouble, they are just trying to make a living, but a firm NO generally works!\nNatural hazards\n[\nedit\n]\nIt wouldn't have been safe to have been in the path of these pyroclastic rocks at La Tarta when they were molten, but now they are a beautiful sight\nTenerife is a volcanic island. The latest outbreak was 1909 from the El Chinyero vent in the northwest part of El Teide. On geologic time scales this is very recent, and although El Teide is dormant, it is still considered to be an active volcano. However, it is constantly monitored very closely so that an upcoming eruption would hopefully be detected well in advance.\nFalling rocks are a constant issue in many parts of the island, and you will often find paths, beaches or even roads temporarily or permanently closed due to the danger.\nThe sun is extremely strong this close to the equator so use plenty of high factor sun cream and do not sun bathe between midday and three o'clock (this is when the beaches are busiest anyway). Remember that the sun is even stronger up in the mountains, even though it may feel cool and breezy.\nThere are no scorpions or snakes to worry about. Mosquitoes can bite at night, especially away from the coast, but they do not carry malaria or similar diseases."

Unfortunately as a tourist through Morocco, especially if you're on a budget, you'll be limited to the handful of dishes that seem to have a monopoly on cafe and restaurant menus throughout the country. Most restaurants serve dishes foreign to Morocco considering that Moroccans can eat their domestic dishes at home. Apart from major cities, Moroccans do not generally eat out in restaurants so choice is generally limited to international fare such as French, Italian and Chinese cuisine.\nTraditional cuisine\n[\nedit\n]\nBissara\n, a thick glop made from split peas and a generous wallop of olive oil can be found bubbling away near markets and in medinas in the mornings. Rarely available in touristy places.\nCouscous\n, made from semolina grains and steamed in a colander-like dish known as a\ncouscoussière\nis a staple food for most North Africans. It can be served as an accompaniment to a stew or\ntagine\n, or mixed with meat and vegetables and presented as a main course. Manual preparation (i.e. not \"instant couscous\") takes hours. Any restaurant that has couscous on the regular menu should be avoided, it will not be the real thing. But lots of restaurants serve couscous once a week (usually Fridays) for lunch and advertise this widely - they tend to make real couscous and often for much better prices.\nFish\non southern beaches is usually very fresh (caught the same day) and cheap. A mixed fish plate comes for about 25 dirham at stalls in the markets of fishing villages, a huge plate of grilled sardines is 15-20 dirham. If bought fresh at the fish market, a kilogram of fish is 5-20 dirham (the latter for a small kind of tuna). Most restaurants in fishing towns have a BBQ in front and will grill any fish you bring them for 30 dirham (includes fries, a salad and bread). Fish is gutted on demand at the markets, just tell them how you want to prepare it (for a BBQ you get a nice butterfly cut, for tagine it is just gutted). A small tip of 1-2 dirham is appropriate for the gutting.\nGhoulal\n: Land snails in a delicious, rich broth can be found at least as far south as Marrakesh at street food stalls. Servings start as low as 3 dirham, in Marrakesh's main square at 10 for the first serving, 5 for every subsequent serving.\nHarira\nis a simple soup made from lentils, chick peas, lamb stock, tomatoes and vegetables, that is nourishing but light on the stomach and can be eaten as part of any meal. Most Moroccans have it at least once a week, many every day. It is even part of the traditional first meal after sunset during Ramadan in Morocco: dates, followed by harira. A serving starts at 3 dirham; on menus it is often referred to as just\nmoroccan soup\nor in French,\nsoupe marocaine\n. It is probably the most \"Moroccan\" dish of all and one cannot really claim to have been to Morocco without having tried it at least once.\nKhlea\n(also:\nkaliya\n) might be more on the adventurous side, taste-wise: meat preserved in fat (mostly lamb, but camel too is produced on industrial scale), usually prepared in a tagine with egg and tomato. The result is very fatty, the meat has a very intense taste and is usually quite chewy. The upside: Starting at 15 dirham, this will get you going for half a day at least. Might be hard to get in touristy restaurants.\nPastilla\nis a popular delicacy in Morocco: Pulled meat in a flaky dough, topped with sugar and cinnamon. Originally made with pigeon fledglings, nowadays the most common variety is made with chicken, though lamb, beef or fish are sometimes used as well. It is sometimes available as a starter on demand, but the real thing is the size of a proper pie and takes hours to prepare. A proper, pre-ordered pigeon fledgling pastilla is at least 200 dirham, 300 to 400 dirham in most touristy places. A large pastilla serves 2 to 4 people.\nSfenj\n: These deep fried donuts from unsweetened yeast dough, dusted with sugar, are a popular and very filling snack that can be found throughout the country for 1 dirham per piece. They want to be eaten very fresh. Look out for stalls with a huge bowl of hot oil.\nTagine\nTagine\n(or\ntajine\n): One cannot be in the country without seeing a \"tagine the dish\" on the menu or a \"tagine, the cooking ware\" in the wild at least once. The very short version is: a \"tagine de ...\" on a menu is a \"steamed ... in a clay pot\". Everything can go into a tagine, but restaurants offer only very few dishes using the same spice formulas, which might become boring soon - albeit, with some luck pigeon or khlea can be found:\ntagine de kefta: meatballs, usually with an egg and anything from \"a few\" to \"lots of\" vegetables; can be rather spicy\ntagine de légumes: vegetables only (but don't count on vegetarian broth)\ntagine de poulet: chicken, usually with preserved lemons (\"en citron\")\ntagine aux pruneaux: lamb or, rarely, beef, with prunes and almonds\ntagine de bœuf/agneau/dromadaire/chèvre: beef/lamb/camel/goat with vegetables\ntagine de(s) poisson/crevettes/poulpe: fish/shrimp/octopus (in coastal regions)\nMsemen:\nkind of puff pastry pancakes that you can buy everywhere on the street. They can be sided to savory or sweet dishes. Most likely you will find msemen for breakfast, with boiled or smashed eggs, with spreadable cheese or with honey and jam. Something you can also find the stuffed version, with vegetables like tomato and onions.\nMany cafés (see Drink) and restaurants also offer good value\npetit déjeuner\nbreakfast deals, which basically include a tea or coffee, orange juice (\njus d'orange\n) and a croissant or bread with marmalade from 10 dirham.\nAt many cheap eating places stews like loubia (white beans), adassa (lentils) and ker ain (sheep foot with chickpeas) are on offer.\nSnacks and fast food\n[\nedit\n]\nSnackers and budget watchers are well catered for in Morocco.\nRotisserie chicken\nshops abound, where you can get a quarter chicken served with fries and salad for around 20 dirham.\nSandwiches\n(from 10 dirham) served from rotisserie chicken shops or hole-in-the-wall establishments are also popular. These fresh crusty baguettes are stuffed with any number of fillings including tuna, chicken,\nbrochettes\nand a variety of salads. This is all usually topped off with the obligatory wad of French fries stuffed into the sandwich and lashings of mayonnaise squeezed on top.\nYou may also see hawkers and vendors selling a variety of\nnuts\n, steamed\nbroad beans\nand barbecued\ncorn cobs\n."

Nothing with a high mineralization produced.\nAs a rule, do not drink tap water at all in Morocco, even in hotels, unless your stomach is \"trained\": Overall the quality is excellent until it reaches the house and if there is a problem the government issues warnings in time, but how water is stored in the house and the condition of the plumbing is questionable.

Even the most financially modest Moroccan is equipped with a tea pot and a few glasses. Although sometimes the offer is more of a lure into a shop than a hospitable gesture, it is polite to accept. Before drinking, look the host in the eye and say\n\"ba saha ou raha\"\nor just\nsaha'\n. It means enjoy and relax and any local will be impressed with your language skills. Be aware, that this is not pure mint tea: It is green tea (gunpowder) to which mint is added after an initial steeping. As such, it can be pretty strong, especially if one is not used to caffeine.

In general the equipment and glasses are clean and the juice is safe to drink, but nothing is guaranteed.\nAlcohol\n[\nedit\n]\nAlthough a predominantly Muslim country, Morocco is\nnot dry\n.\nAlcohol is available in some restaurants, bars, supermarkets (Carrefour and Attacadao), clubs, hotels and discos; some (not strictly legal) liquor stores can be found as well with some research. Lots of Moroccans enjoy a drink although it is disapproved of in public places. The local brew of choice carries the highly original name of Casablanca Beer. It is a full flavored lager and enjoyable with the local cuisine or as a refreshment. The other two major Moroccan beers are Flag Special and Stork. Also you can find local judeo-berber vodka, mild anise flavored and brewed from figs (beware, though, none is produced legally and quality control is non-existent - if the taste reminds you of furniture polish, stay away). Morocco also produces various wines - some of remarkable quality. A bottle in supermarkets start at 35 dirham and go up to 1,000 dirham; a good quality wine can already be had for 50 dirham. In most riads or hotels that serve food but no alcohol, explicitly asking for a bottle of wine will magically make it appear 20 minutes later, though with a markup of at least 100%.\nDriving under the influence of alcohol is illegal even if you drank just one beer\n.\nPlaces\n[\nedit\n]\nCafes and bars are mostly visited by men only, a solo woman may feel more comfortable having a drink or snack at a pastry shop or restaurant. This doesn't apply to couples though."

    "text": "Scratchcard touts\n[\nedit\n]\nIf you are holidaying in Tenerife you are probably going to be approached by \"scratchcard touts\" whose main aim is to part you with several thousand pounds for worthless contracts for time-share apartments. This view is backed up by the UK's Office of Fair Trading who suggest that every year 400,000\nUK consumers\nfall victim to these scams in destinations such as Tenerife, the Costa del Sol and Gran Canaria. On average each victim loses more than £3,000. Bogus \"scratchcard touts\" offer cards that will always be a winner, but to collect their prize, people need to attend a lengthy presentation and are persuaded into signing a contract for an \"exclusive\" club on the basis of false claims as to the price, range and quality of holidays available. The OFT's is advising people to ask three simple questions: can you take away the contract to consider at your leisure? Is everything you were promised in the presentation in the contract? Do you know exactly what you are getting for your money? If the answer to any of these questions is no, then simply walk away."

There are usually very long waits and slow service and you should plan for this in your schedule.\nHotels should be booked well in advance.\nMany people throw firecrackers near pedestrians and it is possible to be burnt or injured.\nSome of the principal fallas, like\nNou Campanar\n, are well outside the city centre and are quite far by foot – it is much easier to take the metro or a bus.\nOne of Spain’s most spectacular fire festivals,\nFalles\n(Spanish:\nFallas\n) can be best characterised as a fire-fireworks-gunpowder street party extravaganza. The festival draws up to two million visitors annually, and is listed as a\nUNESCO\n‘intangible cultural heritage’.\nIts origins date to the Middle Ages when the city’s carpenters burned piles of scraps in the streets and plazas near their workshops on 19 March, the eve of the day of\nSan Josep\n(Spanish:\nSan José\n, or\nSt. Joseph\n). In the 18th century, it became customary to fashion these piles of junk with papier mache into human figures and sculptures, called\nninots\n(Valencian for 'dolls'), which were assembled to form larger\nfallas\n. Eventually these fallas began to take on a satirical nature.\nAround 1870, Falles and Carnival were banned. In response to this, a popular movement arose to revive and preserve these traditions, resulting in a competition in 1885 for the best and most artistic falla. This prompted the development of\ncasal fallers\n, neighbourhood associations which work year-round raising money and designing their fallas. Today there are about 400 casal fallers which each design an adult falla (\nfalla mayor\n), and a smaller children’s falla (\nfalla infantil\n); more than 400 of these fallas are burned on public streets every year. Many fallas reach 25-30 m in height – the best of these are in a special category\nSecció Especial\n(Spanish:\nSección Especiál\n) and compete for the top prize, awarded annually by the City Council.\nA secondary feature of Falles are daily fireworks events, including gunpowder demonstrations (\nmascletàs\n) and large nightly fireworks displays (\ncastillos del fuego\n). Along with these displays, people set off fireworks all day in the streets, beginning early in the morning and continuing throughout the day, making the city seem like a war zone and making it very difficult to catch any sleep.\nKey events and dates\n[\nedit\n]\nFalla de\nSecció Especial\n, surrounded by\nninots\nIlluminated street in Ruzafa\nL'Ofrena\n(The Offering)\nLa Despertà\n(\nthe 'wake-up call'\n).\nLast Sunday of February\n.\nBeginning at 07:30, brass bands parade down Carrer de la Pau and Carrer de Sant Vicent Màrtir to the Plaça de l'Ajuntament, followed by falleros and falleras throwing firecrackers.

Although not as well known as the more elaborate processions in\nAndalusia\nand\nCastile and Leon\n, Valencia's own unique traditions date back to the 15th century and are centred in the neighbourhood of Cabanyal, formerly an independent fishing village. Especially noteworthy are the Good Friday morning processions: two separate fraternities carry a crucifixion effigy to the beach, say a prayer for those who have lost their lives at sea, and place a laurel wreath in the ocean. This practice is unique in Spain and has been designated a 'Fiesta of National Touristic Interest' by the government.\nThe processions, routes, and times may vary from year to year.

After a formal mass at 08:00 in the Plaça de la Virgen, a ceremonial procession transfers the effigy of the Virgin from the royal chapel to the cathedral next door. A second traditional procession begins at 18:30, in which the effigy follows a more circuitous route around the city centre, accompanied by showers of flower petals and dancing in the streets. This procession proceeds along Carrer dels Cavallers, Carrer de la Bosseria, Plaça del Mercat, Carrer de Sant Vicent Màrtir, Plaça de la Reina, and Carrer de les Avellanes before finally returning to the cathedral at Plaça de l'Almoina.\n(\nupdated Aug 2016\n)\nFesta del Corpus Christi\n(\nFiesta de Corpus Christi\n).\n60 days after Easter, usually late May or early June\n.\nThe city has been celebrating Corpus Christi since the late 13th century, and holding feast day processions since 1355. The main procession, known as the\nCavalcada del Convit\n(Spanish:\nCabalgata del Convite\n) begins at 12:00 and follows an itinerary established in the 18th century, which begins at Carrer de la Batlia, heads south along the western side of the cathedral to the Plaça de la Reina, and then up Carrer d'Avellanes and finally terminates at Plaça de l'Almoina. The parade features several medieval dances and rituals unique to Valencia, the most famous of which is\nLa Moma i els Momos\n, in which a man in white dress and white-veiled face is surrounded by seven men clothed and veiled in black; the dance represents the fight of virtue against the seven deadly sins. Also noteworthy are the dances of the\nNanos\n(dwarves) and\nGegants\n(giants), in which dancers wear oversized heads and costumes respectively, and\nLa Poalà\n, in which participants at the end of the route are doused with buckets of water.\n16:30 marks the start of a second procession, the\nPas de les Roques\n(Spanish:\nPaso de las Rocas\n, or Parade of Carriages), the highlight of which are the antique horse-drawn carriages. This parade follows a more circuitous route along Carrer dels Cavallers, Carrer de la Bosseria, Plaça del Mercat, Carrer de Sant Vicent Màrtir, Plaça de la Reina, and Carrer de les Avellanes before finally returning to the cathedral at Plaça de l'Almoina. A third procession begins at 17:30, with the same dancers featured in the 12:00 parade, and following the route of the carriage parade. The final procession, the\nSolemne Processó\n(Spanish:\nSolemne Procesión\n) begins at 19:00, with participants from parishes and guilds followed by biblical characters and finally by the monstrance.\nFree\n.\n(\nupdated Jun 2017\n)\n39.47913\n-0.37669\n4\nCasa de les Roques\n(\nCasa de las Rocas / Museo del Corpus\n),\nCarrer de les Roques, 3\n,\n☏\n+34 963 153 156\n.\nTu-Sa 09:30-14:00 15:00-19:00, Su and holidays 09:30-15:00\n.\nThe horse-drawn carriages used in the Corpus Christi parades, known as\nroques\n(Spanish: rocas, or 'rocks'), have been stored in this building since the mid-15th century.

Participants dress as devils with pitchforks and dance through the streets to drums, setting off fireworks and interacting with spectators. The route varies from year to year, but generally is in the area near the North Train Station and the Porta de la Mar. The many flying sparks can burn holes in clothing, so it's a good idea to wear older clothes or not get too close to the action.\n(\nupdated Jul 2017\n)\n39.4752\n-0.36604\n10\nBatalla de Flors\n(\nBattala de las Flores / Battle of the Flowers\n),\nPasseig de l'Albereda\n(\nPaseo de la Alameda\n).\nLast Sunday of July: parade begins at 20:00, battle begins at 21:00\n.\nThe highlight of the July festival, the 'Battle of the Flowers' was first held in 1891. This unusual event begins with a parade of horse-drawn floats, on which are perched falleras in traditional dress. The floats circle around a closed off section of the avenue four times, and prizes are awarded for the most beautiful float. Then the fun begins: mountains of softball-sized marigolds have been distributed around the ring, and seated audience members proceed to pelt the falleras with the flowers, who defend themselves with tennis rackets and hurl flowers back into the audience. After the parade, the general audience is allowed into the ring, and a general melee begins.\n€30 (ringside seats purchased in advance), free (general audience)\n.\n(\nupdated Jul 2017\n)\nInterior of the Palau de la Generalitat, open to the public during Nou d’Octubre\nNou d’Octubre\n(\nDiada Nacional del País Valencià / Valencian Community National Day\n).\n1-9 October\n.\nThis annual public holiday has been celebrated since 1338 and commemorates the date in 1238 when King James I of Aragón entered the city, freeing it from Moorish rule. In the week leading up to the 9th there are free concerts and parades around town, including a\ncorrefoc\n('fire-running') which takes place on the preceding Saturday evening in the El Carme district. During this same weekend nine governmental palaces which are ordinarily closed to the public are opened for general visitation (Sa and Su 10:00-20:00, free admission). Of these the 15th-century Gothic\n39.47665\n-0.37631\n5\nPalau de la Generalitat\n(\nPalacio de la Generalidad / Palace of the General Assembly\n) is the most remarkable, and is well worth the long queue to see the well-preserved interior.\nFormal festivities commence at midnight on 8 October with a fireworks display from the Túria River park by the Pont de l'Exposició (by Alameda metro station).

The parade starts at 18:30 but it is best to find a spot about a half-hour before the parade begins.\nThe 9th of October is also the day of St. Dionysius, which for Valencians is similar to Valentine's Day. In a tradition dating to the 18th century, it is customary for men to give their sweethearts a\nmocadorà\n– a small bundle of marzipan treats shaped like fruits and wrapped in a handkerchief.

There are usually very long waits and slow service and you should plan for this in your schedule.\nHotels should be booked well in advance.\nMany people throw firecrackers near pedestrians and it is possible to be burnt or injured.\nSome of the principal fallas, like\nNou Campanar\n, are well outside the city centre and are quite far by foot – it is much easier to take the metro or a bus.\nOne of Spain’s most spectacular fire festivals,\nFalles\n(Spanish:\nFallas\n) can be best characterised as a fire-fireworks-gunpowder street party extravaganza. The festival draws up to two million visitors annually, and is listed as a\nUNESCO\n‘intangible cultural heritage’.\nIts origins date to the Middle Ages when the city’s carpenters burned piles of scraps in the streets and plazas near their workshops on 19 March, the eve of the day of\nSan Josep\n(Spanish:\nSan José\n, or\nSt. Joseph\n). In the 18th century, it became customary to fashion these piles of junk with papier mache into human figures and sculptures, called\nninots\n(Valencian for 'dolls'), which were assembled to form larger\nfallas\n. Eventually these fallas began to take on a satirical nature.\nAround 1870, Falles and Carnival were banned. In response to this, a popular movement arose to revive and preserve these traditions, resulting in a competition in 1885 for the best and most artistic falla. This prompted the development of\ncasal fallers\n, neighbourhood associations which work year-round raising money and designing their fallas. Today there are about 400 casal fallers which each design an adult falla (\nfalla mayor\n), and a smaller children’s falla (\nfalla infantil\n); more than 400 of these fallas are burned on public streets every year. Many fallas reach 25-30 m in height – the best of these are in a special category\nSecció Especial\n(Spanish:\nSección Especiál\n) and compete for the top prize, awarded annually by the City Council.\nA secondary feature of Falles are daily fireworks events, including gunpowder demonstrations (\nmascletàs\n) and large nightly fireworks displays (\ncastillos del fuego\n). Along with these displays, people set off fireworks all day in the streets, beginning early in the morning and continuing throughout the day, making the city seem like a war zone and making it very difficult to catch any sleep.\nKey events and dates\n[\nedit\n]\nFalla de\nSecció Especial\n, surrounded by\nninots\nIlluminated street in Ruzafa\nL'Ofrena\n(The Offering)\nLa Despertà\n(\nthe 'wake-up call'\n).\nLast Sunday of February\n.\nBeginning at 07:30, brass bands parade down Carrer de la Pau and Carrer de Sant Vicent Màrtir to the Plaça de l'Ajuntament, followed by falleros and falleras throwing firecrackers.

The latest outbreak was 1909 from the El Chinyero vent in the northwest part of El Teide. On geologic time scales this is very recent, and although El Teide is dormant, it is still considered to be an active volcano. However, it is constantly monitored very closely so that an upcoming eruption would hopefully be detected well in advance.\nFalling rocks are a constant issue in many parts of the island, and you will often find paths, beaches or even roads temporarily or permanently closed due to the danger.\nThe sun is extremely strong this close to the equator so use plenty of high factor sun cream and do not sun bathe between midday and three o'clock (this is when the beaches are busiest anyway). Remember that the sun is even stronger up in the mountains, even though it may feel cool and breezy.\nThere are no scorpions or snakes to worry about. Mosquitoes can bite at night, especially away from the coast, but they do not carry malaria or similar diseases."

It is a full flavored lager and enjoyable with the local cuisine or as a refreshment. The other two major Moroccan beers are Flag Special and Stork. Also you can find local judeo-berber vodka, mild anise flavored and brewed from figs (beware, though, none is produced legally and quality control is non-existent - if the taste reminds you of furniture polish, stay away). Morocco also produces various wines - some of remarkable quality. A bottle in supermarkets start at 35 dirham and go up to 1,000 dirham; a good quality wine can already be had for 50 dirham. In most riads or hotels that serve food but no alcohol, explicitly asking for a bottle of wine will magically make it appear 20 minutes later, though with a markup of at least 100%.\nDriving under the influence of alcohol is illegal even if you drank just one beer\n."

On the lower end of the budget scale, HI-affiliated\nyouth hostels\ncan be found in the major cities (dorm beds from around 50 dirham) while the cheapest\nbudget hotels\n(singles from around 65 dirham) are usually located in the\nmedina\n. Newer, cleaner and slightly more expensive budget (singles from around 75 dirham) and mid-range hotels that are sprinkled throughout the\nville nouvelles\n.\nHotels can sometimes be very basic and often lack hot water and showers, while others will charge you 5-10 dirham for a hot water shower. With the exception of large high end hotels, expect the hot water supply in hotels to not be as stable as in more established countries. In Marrakech, MHamid, near Ourzazate and possibly other places, the hot water temperature varies dramatically while you take a shower. Instead, consider public\nhammams\nas there are quite a lot of them in the\nmedina\nand in rural areas. Hotels in Morocco are a matter of choice and fit every budget. Classified hotels are 1-star (simple) to 5-star (luxury), and are classified as an\nauberge\n,\nriad\n, rural\ngîtes d'étape\nor hotel. Stays usually include breakfast, and many include dinner.\nAuberges\nare found in the country or in rural small towns, and are built in the traditional mud (\nkasbah\n) style, many with wood burning fireplaces and salons or roof terraces for taking meals. Auberge are very comfortable, small and usually family run and owned.\nRiads\nare traditional Moroccan-style housing with a rectangular, multi-storey building and an enclosed interior courtyard/garden. They have thick walls which can serve to moderate the outside temperature fluctuations, making them cooler during the day. Riads are popular in\nMarrakech\n,\nEssaouira\nand\nFes\n, or anywhere there is a medina (old city). They are usually small (about 6 rooms or less), clean and charming, often with to a lovely walled garden where breakfast is served on an inner patio or up on a roof terrace. Riads are usually too small to have a swimming pool, but may have what is called a tiny plunge pool to cool off in during summer months. Some riads are in former merchant houses or palaces and may have large opulent rooms and gardens. (Note, riads are constructed adjacent to one another, and often have smaller windows, letting in less sunshine, both of which can exacerbate\nbed bug\ninfestations and make extermination difficult. Best to check mattress crevices/seams for bugs/carcasses or feces (which present as black dots). Mosquito repellents such as DEET can repel bed bugs to an extent, but do not kill them upon contact, like\nPermethrin\n.) By the way, a\ndar\nis similar, but often has a closed roof.\nGîtes d'étape\nare simple country inns and hostel style places, where mountain trekkers can grab a hot shower, a good meal, and have a roof over their head for one night.\nBecause coastal towns and villages are the destinations of choice for Moroccans to escape the heat from July to early September and because most Moroccans prefer\nfurnished apartments\nover hotels, those towns are swamped with apartments. In the summer months and at peak season for Europeans (Easter, Autumn Holidays and from Christmas until mid-February) people will wait at the roadside at the village entrance, waving with keys. In low season you'll have to ask around (any random person on the street will do). Prices range from 75-200 dirham in low season but can be a multiple in high season. If you want to spend more than just a few days, shop around: Within villages the prices don't vary much for comparable places, but quality of furniture, kitchen equipment, internet connection and TV do a lot.\nDesert\nbivouacs\nare traditional nomad carpeted wool tents with a mattress, sheets and blankets. You can shower at the auberge where you will also have breakfast.\nMany hotels, especially those in the\nmedina\nhave delightful roof terraces, both in cities and the countryside, where you can sleep if the weather's too hot. This will normally cost you 20-25 dirham and you're provided with mattresses and a warm blanket. Just ask the receptionist in the hotel/auberge/gite. If you want to ask in French, which works fairly well, you can say\nca sera possible de dormir sur la terrace, s'il vous plait?\nOften you can bargain on the price and if it's more than 30 dirham you should bargain.\nFor those looking to\ncamp\n, almost every town and city has a campground, although these can often be some way out of the centre. Many of these grounds have water, electricity and cafes. In rural areas and villages, locals are usually more than happy to let you camp on their property; just make sure you ask first. Wild camping is illegal and the fines are steep; though a friendly request to the local police chief will usually get you the permission."

Although not as well known as the more elaborate processions in\nAndalusia\nand\nCastile and Leon\n, Valencia's own unique traditions date back to the 15th century and are centred in the neighbourhood of Cabanyal, formerly an independent fishing village. Especially noteworthy are the Good Friday morning processions: two separate fraternities carry a crucifixion effigy to the beach, say a prayer for those who have lost their lives at sea, and place a laurel wreath in the ocean. This practice is unique in Spain and has been designated a 'Fiesta of National Touristic Interest' by the government.\nThe processions, routes, and times may vary from year to year.

After a formal mass at 08:00 in the Plaça de la Virgen, a ceremonial procession transfers the effigy of the Virgin from the royal chapel to the cathedral next door. A second traditional procession begins at 18:30, in which the effigy follows a more circuitous route around the city centre, accompanied by showers of flower petals and dancing in the streets. This procession proceeds along Carrer dels Cavallers, Carrer de la Bosseria, Plaça del Mercat, Carrer de Sant Vicent Màrtir, Plaça de la Reina, and Carrer de les Avellanes before finally returning to the cathedral at Plaça de l'Almoina.\n(\nupdated Aug 2016\n)\nFesta del Corpus Christi\n(\nFiesta de Corpus Christi\n).\n60 days after Easter, usually late May or early June\n.\nThe city has been celebrating Corpus Christi since the late 13th century, and holding feast day processions since 1355. The main procession, known as the\nCavalcada del Convit\n(Spanish:\nCabalgata del Convite\n) begins at 12:00 and follows an itinerary established in the 18th century, which begins at Carrer de la Batlia, heads south along the western side of the cathedral to the Plaça de la Reina, and then up Carrer d'Avellanes and finally terminates at Plaça de l'Almoina. The parade features several medieval dances and rituals unique to Valencia, the most famous of which is\nLa Moma i els Momos\n, in which a man in white dress and white-veiled face is surrounded by seven men clothed and veiled in black; the dance represents the fight of virtue against the seven deadly sins. Also noteworthy are the dances of the\nNanos\n(dwarves) and\nGegants\n(giants), in which dancers wear oversized heads and costumes respectively, and\nLa Poalà\n, in which participants at the end of the route are doused with buckets of water.\n16:30 marks the start of a second procession, the\nPas de les Roques\n(Spanish:\nPaso de las Rocas\n, or Parade of Carriages), the highlight of which are the antique horse-drawn carriages. This parade follows a more circuitous route along Carrer dels Cavallers, Carrer de la Bosseria, Plaça del Mercat, Carrer de Sant Vicent Màrtir, Plaça de la Reina, and Carrer de les Avellanes before finally returning to the cathedral at Plaça de l'Almoina.

Participants dress as devils with pitchforks and dance through the streets to drums, setting off fireworks and interacting with spectators. The route varies from year to year, but generally is in the area near the North Train Station and the Porta de la Mar.

This unusual event begins with a parade of horse-drawn floats, on which are perched falleras in traditional dress. The floats circle around a closed off section of the avenue four times, and prizes are awarded for the most beautiful float. Then the fun begins: mountains of softball-sized marigolds have been distributed around the ring, and seated audience members proceed to pelt the falleras with the flowers, who defend themselves with tennis rackets and hurl flowers back into the audience. After the parade, the general audience is allowed into the ring, and a general melee begins.\n€30 (ringside seats purchased in advance), free (general audience)\n.\n(\nupdated Jul 2017\n)\nInterior of the Palau de la Generalitat, open to the public during Nou d’Octubre\nNou d’Octubre\n(\nDiada Nacional del País Valencià / Valencian Community National Day\n).\n1-9 October\n.\nThis annual public holiday has been celebrated since 1338 and commemorates the date in 1238 when King James I of Aragón entered the city, freeing it from Moorish rule. In the week leading up to the 9th there are free concerts and parades around town, including a\ncorrefoc\n('fire-running') which takes place on the preceding Saturday evening in the El Carme district. During this same weekend nine governmental palaces which are ordinarily closed to the public are opened for general visitation (Sa and Su 10:00-20:00, free admission). Of these the 15th-century Gothic\n39.47665\n-0.37631\n3\nPalau de la Generalitat\n(\nPalacio de la Generalidad / Palace of the General Assembly\n) is the most remarkable, and is well worth the long queue to see the well-preserved interior.\nFormal festivities commence at midnight on 8 October with a fireworks display from the Túria River park by the Pont de l'Exposició (by Alameda metro station).

The parade starts at 18:30 but it is best to find a spot about a half-hour before the parade begins.\nThe 9th of October is also the day of St. Dionysius, which for Valencians is similar to Valentine's Day. In a tradition dating to the 18th century, it is customary for men to give their sweethearts a\nmocadorà\n– a small bundle of marzipan treats shaped like fruits and wrapped in a handkerchief. Beginning a week before the 9th, these can be purchased at pastry shops and even some supermarkets.\n(\nupdated Oct 2017\n)"

    "text": "Cope\n[\nedit\n]\nIn medinas and souqs you may meet persistent touts and shopkeepers\nSome Moroccans that you meet on the streets have come up with dozens of ways to part you from your money. Keep your wits about you, but don't let your wariness stop you from accepting any offers of generous Moroccan hospitality. Put on a smile and greet everybody that greets you, but still be firm if you are not interested. This will leave you significantly better off than just ignoring them.\nTouts\n[\nedit\n]\nFaux guides\nand touts congregate around tourist areas and will offer to show you around the\nmedinas\n, help you find accommodation, take you to a handicraft warehouse, or even score some drugs. While these men can often be harmless, never accept drugs or other products from them. Be polite, but make it clear if you're not interested in their services, and if they get too persistent, head for a taxi,\nsalon de thé\n, or into the nearest shop - the shopkeeper will show the faux guide away. Though, if it's a shop frequented by tourists, the shopkeeper may be equally eager to get you to buy something.\nThe best way to avoid Faux guides and touts is to avoid eye contact and ignore them, this will generally discourage them as they will try\nto invest\ntheir time in bothering another more willing tourist. Another way is to walk quickly; if eye contact happens just give them a smile, preferably a\nstrong\nand\nbeaming\none rather than a\nshy\none meaning\nno! thanks\n. Responding to everything with a polite but firm\nla shokran\n(Arabic for \"no, thank you\") can be particularly effective, since it doesn't reveal your native language and is understood by bystanders whose attention the tout usually does not want; they might even tell him to leave you alone. Simply\nla\nwould be considered rude in this context, but can be warranted as well.\nPretending you only speak some exotic language and don't understand whatever they say can be an option, too. If you engage in arguing or a conversation with them, you will have a hell of time getting rid of them, as they are incredibly persistent and are masters in harassment, nothing really embarrasses them as they consider this being their way of earning their living.\nSome of the more common tactics to be aware of are as follows.\nMany\nFaux guides\nwill pretend they are students when they approach you and that they just want to practice their English and learn about your culture, invariably if you follow them, there is a big chance you will end up in a carpet or souvenirs shop. A variant is they will show you an English letter and will ask you to translate it for them, or will ask for your help to their English-speaking friend/cousin/relative etc. abroad.\nIn areas of the medina with much accommodation, many young touts will wait for tourists to show them to you their hotel, just to get some dirham. They will claim GPS is not working in the medina and routes are closed. Do not believe them, never tell them the name of your place, ignore them or try to walk them out. Often your accommodation is right where you expect it just a few meters apart from where you are intercepted by the touts.\nExpect to be told that anywhere and everywhere is 'close' or they shout \"medina there\" (even though you are right in the middle of it). Invariably, this is just a way to lull you into trusting them and a con to get you to follow them instead. Do not do this!\nDo not accept 'free gifts' from vendors. You will find that a group of people will approach you accusing you of stealing it, and will extort the price from you.\nAlways insist that prices are fixed beforehand. This is especially true for taxi fares, where trips around a city should cost no more than 20 dirham, in general, or be done on the meter. This cannot be stressed enough. In\nall\nsituations (including Henna tattoos) always agree on a price before!\nBargaining and getting fooled\n[\nedit\n]\nWhen\nbargaining\n, never name a price that you are not willing to pay.\nAt bus/train stations, people will tell you that there have been cancellations, and that you won't be able to get a bus/train. Again, this is almost always a con to get you to accept a hyped-up taxi fare.\nIn general, do not accept the services of people who approach you.\nNever be afraid to say no.\nDo just not fall or give in to any tout behaviour, even if it is just a few euros. This makes it harder for future tourists, and it basically identifies you as being stupid, not knowing local customs and behaviour.\nDrugs\n[\nedit\n]\nAnother favourite of scam artists. In cities around the Rif Mountains, especially\nTetouan\nand\nChefchaouen\n, you will almost certainly be offered\nkif\n(dope). Some dealers will sell you the dope, then turn you in to the police for a cut of the\nbaksheesh\nyou pay to bribe your way out, while others will get you stoned before selling you lawn clippings in plasticine.\nTicket inspectors\n[\nedit\n]\nOn trains inspectors have reportedly attempted to extricate a few extra dirham from unsuspecting tourists by finding something 'wrong' with their tickets. Make sure your tickets are in order before you board, and if you find yourself being hassled, insist on taking the matter up with the station manager at your destination.\nToilets\n[\nedit\n]\nMoroccan toilets, even those in hotels or restaurants, could lack\ntoilet paper\n. It is worth buying a roll (French: \"\npapier hygienique\n\").\nTalk\n[\nedit\n]\nTry to learn at least a phrasebook level of competency in French or Arabic (Spanish may help you in the North - but not largely). Just being able to say\n\"Ith'hab!\" or \"Seer f'halek\"\n(\"Go Away!\") may be useful to you... Many locals (especially the nice ones who are not trying to take advantage of you) will speak limited English. Making a real effort to speak Arabic or Moroccan Arabic means a great deal to many Moroccans, including the majority who are multilingual, and puts you at an advantage as regards scams and bargaining. If you can at least verify prices in French with locals, you could end up saving a lot of money.\nWhat to wear\n[\nedit\n]\nYou won't need high and heavy mountain boots unless you go in coldest time of the year like February: it's quite warm in the country even when it's heavy raining in November. For trekking in valleys, low trekking shoes will be likely enough. Even in medinas, streets are paved if not asphalted—just be sure your footwear is not toeless in the medina, as garbage services are limited and fish scraps from the markets and the like tend to end up on the street. However, many Moroccan homes, most cheaper hotels, and nearly all buses have no heating, and winter nights drop to zero; you may need more layers than you will expect.\nFor a desert trip to dunes, ensure your pockets can be easily shaken out as sand gets in there very quickly.\nLaundry services are exceptionally few and far between, although some hotels will provide them for a price and dry cleaners are plentiful. A few laundromats or similar do exist in newer sections of some cities, but are hard to find. It won't save you money to buy new clothes instead of washing your old ones, but it's a close thing.\nTime\n[\nedit\n]\nMorocco operates Daylight Saving Time except for during Ramadan.\nThe further south you go, the more people refuse to use daylight saving time (also called \"political time\" in contrast to \"wild time\"); state-run places there will always obey DST, merchants not necessarily."

    "text": "Touts\n[\nedit\n]\nFaux guides\nand touts congregate around tourist areas and will offer to show you around the\nmedinas\n, help you find accommodation, take you to a handicraft warehouse, or even score some drugs. While these men can often be harmless, never accept drugs or other products from them. Be polite, but make it clear if you're not interested in their services, and if they get too persistent, head for a taxi,\nsalon de thé\n, or into the nearest shop - the shopkeeper will show the faux guide away. Though, if it's a shop frequented by tourists, the shopkeeper may be equally eager to get you to buy something.\nThe best way to avoid Faux guides and touts is to avoid eye contact and ignore them, this will generally discourage them as they will try\nto invest\ntheir time in bothering another more willing tourist. Another way is to walk quickly; if eye contact happens just give them a smile, preferably a\nstrong\nand\nbeaming\none rather than a\nshy\none meaning\nno! thanks\n. Responding to everything with a polite but firm\nla shokran\n(Arabic for \"no, thank you\") can be particularly effective, since it doesn't reveal your native language and is understood by bystanders whose attention the tout usually does not want; they might even tell him to leave you alone. Simply\nla\nwould be considered rude in this context, but can be warranted as well.\nPretending you only speak some exotic language and don't understand whatever they say can be an option, too. If you engage in arguing or a conversation with them, you will have a hell of time getting rid of them, as they are incredibly persistent and are masters in harassment, nothing really embarrasses them as they consider this being their way of earning their living.\nSome of the more common tactics to be aware of are as follows.\nMany\nFaux guides\nwill pretend they are students when they approach you and that they just want to practice their English and learn about your culture, invariably if you follow them, there is a big chance you will end up in a carpet or souvenirs shop. A variant is they will show you an English letter and will ask you to translate it for them, or will ask for your help to their English-speaking friend/cousin/relative etc. abroad.\nIn areas of the medina with much accommodation, many young touts will wait for tourists to show them to you their hotel, just to get some dirham. They will claim GPS is not working in the medina and routes are closed. Do not believe them, never tell them the name of your place, ignore them or try to walk them out. Often your accommodation is right where you expect it just a few meters apart from where you are intercepted by the touts.\nExpect to be told that anywhere and everywhere is 'close' or they shout \"medina there\" (even though you are right in the middle of it). Invariably, this is just a way to lull you into trusting them and a con to get you to follow them instead. Do not do this!\nDo not accept 'free gifts' from vendors. You will find that a group of people will approach you accusing you of stealing it, and will extort the price from you.\nAlways insist that prices are fixed beforehand. This is especially true for taxi fares, where trips around a city should cost no more than 20 dirham, in general, or be done on the meter. This cannot be stressed enough. In\nall\nsituations (including Henna tattoos) always agree on a price before!"

Again, this is almost always a con to get you to accept a hyped-up taxi fare.\nIn general, do not accept the services of people who approach you.\nNever be afraid to say no.\nDo just not fall or give in to any tout behaviour, even if it is just a few euros.

    "text": "Stay safe\n[\nedit\n]\n\"Camel guard\" on horse at Mausoleum Mohammad V, Rabat\nOverall, Morocco remains a relatively safe place.\nLike any country, Morocco has its share of problems. Many can be easily avoided by following common sense. Avoid dark alleys. Travel in a group whenever possible. Keep money and passports in a safety wallet or in a hotel safety deposit box. Keep backpacks and purses with you at all times. Make sure there is nothing important in outside or back pockets.\nDrug laws are incredibly harsh in Morocco, as are the laws against prostitution and the importation, distribution and production of pornography.\nReligious matters\n[\nedit\n]\nAlthough the Moroccan constitution allows for freedom of religion, the clause on religious freedom is loosely defined and widely open to interpretation.\nIt is unwise to speak badly of\nIslam\n, hand out non-Islamic religious literature, or encourage Moroccans to participate in religious debates. Such actions will attract unwanted attention from the authorities and people, including expatriates, have been arrested for engaging in such activities. Attempting to preach or proselytise is also unwise, and you can expect to be heavily punished by the Moroccan authorities for doing so.\nThere's nothing wrong with bringing bibles and other religious texts into the country so long as you use them for personal use.\nWomen travellers\n[\nedit\n]\nWomen especially will experience constant harassment if alone, but this is usually just cat-calls and (disturbingly) hisses. Don't feel the need to be polite — no Moroccan woman would put up with behaviour like that. Dark sunglasses make it easier to avoid eye contact. If someone won't leave you alone, look for families, a busy shop, or a local woman and don't be afraid to ask for help. If you are so inclined, you could wear a\nhijab\n(headscarf), but this is not necessary. Morocco can be a liberal country and many Moroccan women do not wear headscarves. However, women should\nalways\ndress conservatively (no low-cut tops, midriffs, or shorts), out of respect for the local culture. In cities, women can wear more revealing clothing, but as a general rule they should follow the lead from local women. Locals will also assume that Moroccan women venturing into\nville nouvelle\nnightclubs or bars alone are prostitutes in search of clientèle. Foreign women entering such places will be not be so considered but will be thought of as approachable.\nMajor annoyances\n[\nedit\n]\nBe careful about being drugged, especially as a solo traveller. The common and easy-to-make drug GHB only lasts 3 hours and is undetectable in the body after 7 hours, so if you are attacked take action immediately.\nHustlers can be a big problem for people travelling to Morocco, and Tangier in particular. It's often difficult to walk down the street without being accosted by somebody offering to give you directions or sell you something. Your best bet is to politely refuse their services and keep walking, as all they are after is money. There are some legitimate tour guides, but your guide will receive a commission on anything you buy while you're with them, so don't let yourself be pressured into purchasing anything you don't want.\nDriving under the influence of alcohol is strictly illegal\neven if you drink just one beer.\nIn certain places, hustlers will do their best to intimidate you, and they can be very clingy, insisting that you give them money or offering their 'services'. Don't be intimidated by this; usually a firm \"No\" does the trick. Some of them can get nasty and abusive but before it gets to that stage walk towards a shop or crowd. Most Moroccans would immediately tell the person off if they see that you are being harassed.\nDangerous areas\n[\nedit\n]\nArmed fighting in the disputed areas of the Western Sahara is less frequent now, but clashes between government forces and the Polisario Front still occur. Don't wander too far off the beaten path either, as this region is also\nheavily-mined\n.\nDon't get too close to the Mauritanian border due to terrorism, kidnapping, and murder.\nDual nationals\n[\nedit\n]\nDual citizenship is recognised by Morocco.\nIf you are regarded\nMoroccan\nby the authorities, such as by being a dual citizen or having a Moroccan father, you will be treated as a Moroccan citizen.\nIn the unlikely event you get arrested, run into any kind of legal trouble, or get detained, your embassy will have little influence in assisting you.\nNatural disasters\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nEarthquakes\nThe country is located near the boundary between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate, which is a seismically active zone. However, most earthquakes in Morocco are small and cause little damage.\nThe last major earthquake ― thought to be the deadliest earthquake since the 1960 Agadir earthquake ― occurred in September 2023, culminating in thousands of deaths and injuries. Morocco building standards are poor; many buildings are poorly constructed and are not able to withstand the full force of a major earthquake.\nLGBT travellers\n[\nedit\n]\nNote:\nSame-sex sexual activity is punishable by 6 months to 3 years imprisonment and a fine of up to 1000 dirhams.\nMorocco is\nnot a safe\ndestination for\ngay and lesbian travellers\n; Morocco's cultural and legal systems view homosexuality as immoral and anti-LGBT sentiments are common among the population.\nIn 2014, a gay British traveller was prosecuted and imprisoned for four months after police found incriminating photographs on his phone."

Take the usual precautions against being bitten (light coloured clothing, insect repellent, etc.) and if you are really worried see your doctor about anti-malarial medication before your departure.\nMedical help\n[\nedit\n]\nMorocco has a public and private health care system. Most of the private sector health services are located in Casablanca, Rabat and other larger cities. Outside the major cities, health services are limited. The level of healthcare is not at the same level as in Europe. There can be large differences between private and public hospitals.\nMedical treatment can be obtained from self-employed doctors, clinics and hospitals. Most general practitioners, specialists, and dentists are self-employed; look for signs saying \"Docteur\". An average doctor's check-up in a city costs 150-300 dirham. In general, the quality of their work is decent, but you can try to ask some locals for advice and recommendations.\nSpecialist health care services are not always available. Dental care is of a reasonable standard and prices are in line with those in western countries.\nStaff in private and public hospitals are highly educated, but English is poorly spoken or not spoken at all. Doctors and nursing staff often speak French. In private clinics, language skills are more common. In public hospitals, emergency care is free of charge, but in practice foreigners are always required to pay for treatment, for example for overnight stays. Moroccan private hospitals offer a higher standard of care than the public sector and, if possible, it is advisable to go directly to a private clinic. If your condition in Morocco requires more complex treatment, it is advisable to seek the opinion of two different doctors.\nPayments for medical and hospital services are required from foreigners in cash. The possibility of payment by credit card is rare. Ambulance services may have to be paid in advance.\nTravellers to Morocco are advised to take out comprehensive travel insurance. Hotels in major tourist areas may have their own clinic or doctor. They also provide treatment outside office hours. There are also doctors in Morocco who make home visits.\nIf you are in northern Morocco near the Spanish regions of Ceuta or Melilla on the African continent, you can move to the Spanish side, where you can get treatment with a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).\nMorocco has a very large number of pharmacies in both urban and rural areas. You can usually find the contact details of the pharmacy on duty on the doors of pharmacies or by using internet search services. Pharmacies are denoted by a green cross, usually in neon. They sell medicines, contraceptives, and often beauty and related products. For minor problems, they double as a medical advisor. Be prepared to describe your problem even when you know exactly what you need. Most common prescription and over-the-counter medicines are readily available, but specialised medicines can be difficult to obtain. Sometimes pharmacies can order the medicine you need with short delivery times. Pharmacies can also provide information about medical services in your area."

This is a sure sign for frozen/microwaved paella.\nWhen possible, make reservations or arrive early (no later than 14:00), especially on Sunday, because these restaurants fill up quite quickly on the weekend.\nPaella is typically eaten at mid-day (between 14:00-17:00), so many restaurants do not serve it at dinner. Be careful of those that do as this is not the custom here and the quality of the paella may be poor.\nThe paella pan is of a size that almost all restaurants require a minimum of two servings for an order. Restaurants that allow ordering one order are likely serving frozen paella.\nArròs negre\nPaella\n.\nThere are several versions of this tasteful rice dish:\npaella valenciana\n, with meat (chicken and/or rabbit usually),\npaella de marisco\n, with fish or seafood, or even\npaella mixta\n, with meat and fish at the same time, the least popular among locals. It is very difficult to say which is the 'real' paella, as every person has his/her own version (though\nno\npaella that deserves this name contains sausage, ham or meat broth, for instance). If you want to eat an authentic paella, try it at the Malvarrosa beach area; you will find there are several good restaurants. The authentic Valencian paella is made only with fresh ingredients, in a special iron pan and using a fire made with wood (not gas or electricity). Vegetarian paella is called\npaella vegetal\nor\npaella de verduras\n. Authentic paella can be rather dry, it's not a soup and shouldn't look like gumbo. Don't be shy about scraping the caramelized rice from the bottom of the pan, it's delicious!\n(\nupdated Jun 2017\n)\nArròs a banda\n(\narroz a banda\n).\nA side dish of rice cooked in fish stock, usually served with alioli.\n(\nupdated Jun 2017\n)\nArròs negre\n(\narroz negro\n).\nAlso cooked in fish stock, this rice dish is black because it contains squid ink, as well as squid or cuttlefish, peppers, and paprika.\n(\nupdated Jun 2017\n)\nFideuà\n.\nThis paella-like dish, with short noodles and fish, was invented in\nGandía\nand can be usually found in paella restaurants. It deserves a try too.\n(\nupdated Jun 2017\n)\nAll i pebre\n.\nA stew made of eel, a snake like fish typical from the\nAlbufera\n, a lagoon near Valencia. You can drive to El Palmar and taste it there. Delicious, but a very special taste. You can find good paella, and other traditional dishes at the restaurants there too.\n(\nupdated Jun 2017\n)\nLlet merengada\n(\nleche merengada\n).\nA kind of milk-based soft ice cream with a cinnamon-lemon taste.\n(\nupdated Jun 2017\n)\nBunyols\n(\nbuñuelos\n).\nFried doughnuts, sometimes round shaped, sometimes like rings. Widely available only during March during the Falles celebration. Dip them in hot chocolate. Sometimes they are too oily, so don't eat a lot of them or you will not be hungry again for several hours.

    "text": "Medical help\n[\nedit\n]\nMorocco has a public and private health care system. Most of the private sector health services are located in Casablanca, Rabat and other larger cities. Outside the major cities, health services are limited. The level of healthcare is not at the same level as in Europe. There can be large differences between private and public hospitals.\nMedical treatment can be obtained from self-employed doctors, clinics and hospitals. Most general practitioners, specialists, and dentists are self-employed; look for signs saying \"Docteur\". An average doctor's check-up in a city costs 150-300 dirham. In general, the quality of their work is decent, but you can try to ask some locals for advice and recommendations.\nSpecialist health care services are not always available. Dental care is of a reasonable standard and prices are in line with those in western countries.\nStaff in private and public hospitals are highly educated, but English is poorly spoken or not spoken at all. Doctors and nursing staff often speak French. In private clinics, language skills are more common. In public hospitals, emergency care is free of charge, but in practice foreigners are always required to pay for treatment, for example for overnight stays. Moroccan private hospitals offer a higher standard of care than the public sector and, if possible, it is advisable to go directly to a private clinic. If your condition in Morocco requires more complex treatment, it is advisable to seek the opinion of two different doctors.\nPayments for medical and hospital services are required from foreigners in cash. The possibility of payment by credit card is rare. Ambulance services may have to be paid in advance.\nTravellers to Morocco are advised to take out comprehensive travel insurance. Hotels in major tourist areas may have their own clinic or doctor. They also provide treatment outside office hours. There are also doctors in Morocco who make home visits.\nIf you are in northern Morocco near the Spanish regions of Ceuta or Melilla on the African continent, you can move to the Spanish side, where you can get treatment with a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).\nMorocco has a very large number of pharmacies in both urban and rural areas. You can usually find the contact details of the pharmacy on duty on the doors of pharmacies or by using internet search services. Pharmacies are denoted by a green cross, usually in neon. They sell medicines, contraceptives, and often beauty and related products. For minor problems, they double as a medical advisor. Be prepared to describe your problem even when you know exactly what you need. Most common prescription and over-the-counter medicines are readily available, but specialised medicines can be difficult to obtain. Sometimes pharmacies can order the medicine you need with short delivery times. Pharmacies can also provide information about medical services in your area."

    "text": "Respect\n[\nedit\n]\nRamadan\nRamadan is the 9th and holiest month in the Islamic calendar and lasts 29–30 days. Muslims fast every day for its duration and most restaurants will be closed until the fast breaks at dusk. Nothing (including water and cigarettes) is supposed to pass through the lips from dawn to sunset. Non-Muslims are exempt from this, but should still refrain from eating or drinking in public as this is considered very impolite. Working hours are decreased as well in the corporate world.\nExact dates of Ramadan depend on local astronomical observations and may vary somewhat from country to country. Ramadan concludes with the festival of\nEid al-Fitr\n, which may last several days, usually three in most countries.\n1 March – 29 March 2025 (\n1446 AH\n)\n18 February – 19 March 2026 (\n1447 AH\n)\n8 February – 8 March 2027 (\n1448 AH\n)\n28 January – 25 February 2028 (\n1449 AH\n)\nIf you're planning to travel to Morocco during Ramadan, consider reading\nTravelling during Ramadan\n.\nAs in all of North Africa, the dominant religion is Islam, therefore, appropriate religious prohibitions and attitudes should be in order. If visiting a mosque, for example, be sure to be dressed conservatively and remove your shoes before entering it.\nSocial etiquette\n[\nedit\n]\nMoroccans are indirect communicators\n. They are tempered by the need to save face and protect and honour and they will avoid saying anything that could be construed as judgemental or negative. One's point is expressed in a roundabout way.\nDo not beckon a Moroccan person directly\n, even if they've done something wrong in your opinion. It is considered impolite. Under Moroccan law, you can be taken to court for this.\nKissing cheeks\nis practiced between members of the same gender, close friends, and family. You should not do this to someone of the opposite gender unless you're close to them. If in doubt, a\nhandshake\nis the way to go. One way to demonstrate respect and sincerity: Touch your heart with your right hand after shaking someone's hand.\nWhen greeting someone you don't know,\nalways say \"Salaam Alaykum\"\n(\"peace upon you\"), which is the standard, formal greeting. In informal settings, people often greet each other with \"Salaam\".\nThe left hand is considered unhygienic\n. Try not to shake hands or accept something from someone with your left hand as it is considered impolite.\nMoroccans respect their elders\n. If you come across someone who is older than you, give up your seat on public transportation for them. If you're waiting for a taxi, allow someone older to take your spot. You are expected to act politely around someone older than you, and it would be seen as rude manners if you attempt to challenge someone older than you.\nSmoking kif or\nhashish\nis part of Moroccan culture and widely tolerated (though officially illegal). This said, it's frowned upon to smoke on crowded beaches or in cafes or restaurants without the owner's consent - it is OK, even expected, to ask for permission.\nDress smartly and conservatively in public\n. For men, it's advisable to wear long trousers and sleeved shirts, and women shouldn't wear see-through dresses. In hotels and beach clubs, there's no issue with donning swimsuits, bikinis, and shorts.\nPublic displays of affection aren't socially accepted\n. People can get arrested for doing this.\nThings to avoid\n[\nedit\n]\nMoroccans will understand that you are not fully aware of what's considered appropriate/inappropriate in their country, and they will usually be tolerant of your blunders. This said, there are some things which will be met with disapproval and you should avoid doing the following during your stay in the country.\nPolitics\n[\nedit\n]\nPolitical discourse tends to be highly sensitive in Morocco and some have been arrested for speaking out against the government and state institutions. Keep your political views to yourself.\nThe Moroccan royal family is protected by strict lèse–majesté laws and the constitution states that the reigning monarch is \"inviolable\". In other words, insulting, making fun of them, questioning their rule (this also includes advocating for republicanism), or speaking out against them is punishable by up to\nfive years of imprisonment\n.\nIt is a social faux pas to discuss the royal family's economic power and involvement in the business world.\nAvoid talking about\nWestern Sahara\nand Sahrawi nationalism. Doing so could get you into trouble with the authorities.\nAvoid talking about\nAlgeria\n. Since the 1960s, the two countries have had strained relations and some Moroccans, particularly the older generations, harbor strong feelings towards Algeria and Algerian people. In 1975, Algeria expelled thousands of Moroccans from Algeria, separating many Moroccans from their family members.\nSymbols\n[\nedit\n]\nAccording to the Moroccan penal code, it is\nillegal\nto show contempt − satirising, desecrating, and so on − for the symbols (the flag, the coat of arms, the national motto) of Morocco.\nReligion\n[\nedit\n]\nIslam\nis the dominant religion in Morocco, and Islam plays an essential role in the lives of every Moroccan. During\nRamadan\n, you should refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, and chewing in public. Not doing so would be seen as highly disrespectful. The Jewish and Christian minorities are generally free to practise their religions.  It is illegal to attempt to convert someone to any religion other than Islam.\nRefrain from criticising or speaking badly about religion, and refrain from talking about religion from an agnostic point of view. Even highly educated Moroccans won't appreciate it."

Try not to shake hands or accept something from someone with your left hand as it is considered impolite.\nMoroccans respect their elders\n. If you come across someone who is older than you, give up your seat on public transportation for them. If you're waiting for a taxi, allow someone older to take your spot. You are expected to act politely around someone older than you, and it would be seen as rude manners if you attempt to challenge someone older than you.\nSmoking kif or\nhashish\nis part of Moroccan culture and widely tolerated (though officially illegal). This said, it's frowned upon to smoke on crowded beaches or in cafes or restaurants without the owner's consent - it is OK, even expected, to ask for permission.\nDress smartly and conservatively in public\n. For men, it's advisable to wear long trousers and sleeved shirts, and women shouldn't wear see-through dresses. In hotels and beach clubs, there's no issue with donning swimsuits, bikinis, and shorts.\nPublic displays of affection aren't socially accepted\n. People can get arrested for doing this."

    "text": "Things to avoid\n[\nedit\n]\nMoroccans will understand that you are not fully aware of what's considered appropriate/inappropriate in their country, and they will usually be tolerant of your blunders. This said, there are some things which will be met with disapproval and you should avoid doing the following during your stay in the country.\nPolitics\n[\nedit\n]\nPolitical discourse tends to be highly sensitive in Morocco and some have been arrested for speaking out against the government and state institutions. Keep your political views to yourself.\nThe Moroccan royal family is protected by strict lèse–majesté laws and the constitution states that the reigning monarch is \"inviolable\". In other words, insulting, making fun of them, questioning their rule (this also includes advocating for republicanism), or speaking out against them is punishable by up to\nfive years of imprisonment\n.\nIt is a social faux pas to discuss the royal family's economic power and involvement in the business world.\nAvoid talking about\nWestern Sahara\nand Sahrawi nationalism. Doing so could get you into trouble with the authorities.\nAvoid talking about\nAlgeria\n. Since the 1960s, the two countries have had strained relations and some Moroccans, particularly the older generations, harbor strong feelings towards Algeria and Algerian people. In 1975, Algeria expelled thousands of Moroccans from Algeria, separating many Moroccans from their family members.\nSymbols\n[\nedit\n]\nAccording to the Moroccan penal code, it is\nillegal\nto show contempt − satirising, desecrating, and so on − for the symbols (the flag, the coat of arms, the national motto) of Morocco.\nReligion\n[\nedit\n]\nIslam\nis the dominant religion in Morocco, and Islam plays an essential role in the lives of every Moroccan. During\nRamadan\n, you should refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, and chewing in public. Not doing so would be seen as highly disrespectful. The Jewish and Christian minorities are generally free to practise their religions.  It is illegal to attempt to convert someone to any religion other than Islam.\nRefrain from criticising or speaking badly about religion, and refrain from talking about religion from an agnostic point of view. Even highly educated Moroccans won't appreciate it."

The international dialling prefix (to dial\nout\nof the country) is 00. All normal numbers are ten digits long, counting the initial\n0\n(area code prefix) and the whole number must be dialled even for local calls within the same area code.\nUseful numbers\n[\nedit\n]\nPolice:\n19\n. Moroccan Royal Gendarmerie:\n17\nFire Service:\n15\nHighway Emergency Service:\n177\nDomestic directory: 160\nInternational directory: 120\nTelegrams and telephone: 140\nIntercity operator: 100\nMobile\n[\nedit\n]\nThe mobile telephone network in Morocco can be accessed via one of major operators:\nOrange\n,\nInwi\nor\nMaroc Telecom\n(IAM -\nIttisalat Al Maghrib\n, owned by Etisalat). Network coverage is generally good in populated areas and mostly also in the countryside. According to OpenSignal, all three providers are similarly good. Maroc Telecom has the best coverage in rural areas (including most parts of\nWestern Sahara\n). The network of Maroc Telecom has also the best consistent quality. (updated September 2022)\nMore information on available services, coverage and roaming partners are available at:\nGSMWorld\n. Beware that roaming with international cards from most countries is very expensive, so think about buying a local card.\nSIM cards\n[\nedit\n]\nSIM cards can be purchased, though some vendors require an ID; the card itself is free, the fee paid is credited to the account. The fee credited to the account is sufficient to make a few brief phone calls. They can be purchased in various shops that sport the official logo but not in all (rule of thumb: not in a kiosk, but any electronics shop works and of course the official stores of the companies).  Some places that sell houseware goods may sell SIM, just ask the cashier.  Arabic and French both use \"SIM\", repeating the word will either get you the SIM or directions to the next shop where you can get one.\neSIM cards are available to purchase and activate entirely online for those phones which are compatible. As of May 2025, Maroc Telecom are offering an eSIM with unlimited 4G data over 14 days for 320.00 MAD. To activate the eSIM you need to complete set-up and then call '555'. Once activated, to finally get online, you need to text 'Internet' to 505, and your data will be connected within moments.\nTop-ups\ncome in the form of scratch cards for 5 to 100 dirham which can be purchased anywhere, just look for the logo of the phone company. Many convenience stores that sell bottled water will also sell top-ups.  The cards are used by sending the scratch code to some number which is explained on the scratch card itself: 555 for Maroc Telecom and Orange, 120 for INWI.  When calling in to apply the top up to your account, keep in mind that the prompts will be in French or Arabic, so if you do not understand either, make arrangements for someone to assist you.  Also keep in mind that when topping up, you will be given the option of applying the top up to data or to call time.\nData plans\nare available for as little as 5 dirham per 500 MB. But 17 GB and 2 hr call, or 15 GB and 5 hr call can be had for as little as 100 dirham.  While you can buy SIM cards at some Moroccan international airports from stalls operated by the major operators, the price is considerably higher than elsewhere, for instance in December 2024, the lowest price plan at Marrakech airport was 20 Euros (about 200 dirhams) for 20 GB and 5 hours talk talk.  In contrast, a 30 dirham SIM card and a 50 dirham top up card, were sufficient in December 2024 to provide 7.5 GB of data and a brief amount of call time.\nPost\n[\nedit\n]\nMoroccan letterbox\nThe Moroccan postal service is generally reliable and offers a\npost restante\nservice in major cities for a small fee. You will need some identification (preferably your passport) to collect your mail.\nItems shipped as\nfreight\nare inspected at the post office before they are sent, so wait until this has been done before you seal the box.\nEmail and internet\n[\nedit\n]\nMoroccans have really taken to the internet.\nInternet cafes\nare open late and are numerous in cities and smaller towns that see significant tourist traffic. Rates are 3-4 dirham per hour and they are often located next to, above, or below the\ntelekiosque\noffices. Speeds are acceptable to excellent in the north, but can be a little on the slow side in rural areas. Most internet cafes will allow you to print and burn CDs for a small charge. Almost every restaurant and cafe offers wifi for free with usually acceptable speed.\nMoroccans have also really taken to 3G and 4G/LTE coverage. There is a good access to email and the internet via Mobile Phones and it is relatively inexpensive. There is 3G access even in the desert, as well as in all cities. You can easily use the mobile internet network by buying a prepaid card (see mobile section). For Maroc Telecom, data-only packages can be purchased by appending \"*3\" to the top-up code.\nAs of 2017, fiber connections are rolled out throughout the country, with newly installed 4G-towers as backup."

    "text": "Telephone\n[\nedit\n]\nPublic telephones\ncan be found in city centres, but private\ntelephone offices\n(also known as\nteleboutiques\nor\ntelekiosques\n) are also commonly used. The international dialling prefix (to dial\nout\nof the country) is 00. All normal numbers are ten digits long, counting the initial\n0\n(area code prefix) and the whole number must be dialled even for local calls within the same area code.\nUseful numbers\n[\nedit\n]\nPolice:\n19\n. Moroccan Royal Gendarmerie:\n17\nFire Service:\n15\nHighway Emergency Service:\n177\nDomestic directory: 160\nInternational directory: 120\nTelegrams and telephone: 140\nIntercity operator: 100\nMobile\n[\nedit\n]\nThe mobile telephone network in Morocco can be accessed via one of major operators:\nOrange\n,\nInwi\nor\nMaroc Telecom\n(IAM -\nIttisalat Al Maghrib\n, owned by Etisalat). Network coverage is generally good in populated areas and mostly also in the countryside. According to OpenSignal, all three providers are similarly good. Maroc Telecom has the best coverage in rural areas (including most parts of\nWestern Sahara\n). The network of Maroc Telecom has also the best consistent quality. (updated September 2022)\nMore information on available services, coverage and roaming partners are available at:\nGSMWorld\n. Beware that roaming with international cards from most countries is very expensive, so think about buying a local card.\nSIM cards\n[\nedit\n]\nSIM cards can be purchased, though some vendors require an ID; the card itself is free, the fee paid is credited to the account. The fee credited to the account is sufficient to make a few brief phone calls. They can be purchased in various shops that sport the official logo but not in all (rule of thumb: not in a kiosk, but any electronics shop works and of course the official stores of the companies).  Some places that sell houseware goods may sell SIM, just ask the cashier.  Arabic and French both use \"SIM\", repeating the word will either get you the SIM or directions to the next shop where you can get one.\neSIM cards are available to purchase and activate entirely online for those phones which are compatible. As of May 2025, Maroc Telecom are offering an eSIM with unlimited 4G data over 14 days for 320.00 MAD. To activate the eSIM you need to complete set-up and then call '555'. Once activated, to finally get online, you need to text 'Internet' to 505, and your data will be connected within moments.\nTop-ups\ncome in the form of scratch cards for 5 to 100 dirham which can be purchased anywhere, just look for the logo of the phone company. Many convenience stores that sell bottled water will also sell top-ups.  The cards are used by sending the scratch code to some number which is explained on the scratch card itself: 555 for Maroc Telecom and Orange, 120 for INWI.  When calling in to apply the top up to your account, keep in mind that the prompts will be in French or Arabic, so if you do not understand either, make arrangements for someone to assist you.  Also keep in mind that when topping up, you will be given the option of applying the top up to data or to call time.\nData plans\nare available for as little as 5 dirham per 500 MB. But 17 GB and 2 hr call, or 15 GB and 5 hr call can be had for as little as 100 dirham.  While you can buy SIM cards at some Moroccan international airports from stalls operated by the major operators, the price is considerably higher than elsewhere, for instance in December 2024, the lowest price plan at Marrakech airport was 20 Euros (about 200 dirhams) for 20 GB and 5 hours talk talk.  In contrast, a 30 dirham SIM card and a 50 dirham top up card, were sufficient in December 2024 to provide 7.5 GB of data and a brief amount of call time."

    "text": "SIM cards\n[\nedit\n]\nSIM cards can be purchased, though some vendors require an ID; the card itself is free, the fee paid is credited to the account. The fee credited to the account is sufficient to make a few brief phone calls. They can be purchased in various shops that sport the official logo but not in all (rule of thumb: not in a kiosk, but any electronics shop works and of course the official stores of the companies).  Some places that sell houseware goods may sell SIM, just ask the cashier.  Arabic and French both use \"SIM\", repeating the word will either get you the SIM or directions to the next shop where you can get one.\neSIM cards are available to purchase and activate entirely online for those phones which are compatible. As of May 2025, Maroc Telecom are offering an eSIM with unlimited 4G data over 14 days for 320.00 MAD. To activate the eSIM you need to complete set-up and then call '555'. Once activated, to finally get online, you need to text 'Internet' to 505, and your data will be connected within moments.\nTop-ups\ncome in the form of scratch cards for 5 to 100 dirham which can be purchased anywhere, just look for the logo of the phone company. Many convenience stores that sell bottled water will also sell top-ups.  The cards are used by sending the scratch code to some number which is explained on the scratch card itself: 555 for Maroc Telecom and Orange, 120 for INWI.  When calling in to apply the top up to your account, keep in mind that the prompts will be in French or Arabic, so if you do not understand either, make arrangements for someone to assist you.  Also keep in mind that when topping up, you will be given the option of applying the top up to data or to call time.\nData plans\nare available for as little as 5 dirham per 500 MB. But 17 GB and 2 hr call, or 15 GB and 5 hr call can be had for as little as 100 dirham.  While you can buy SIM cards at some Moroccan international airports from stalls operated by the major operators, the price is considerably higher than elsewhere, for instance in December 2024, the lowest price plan at Marrakech airport was 20 Euros (about 200 dirhams) for 20 GB and 5 hours talk talk.  In contrast, a 30 dirham SIM card and a 50 dirham top up card, were sufficient in December 2024 to provide 7.5 GB of data and a brief amount of call time."
